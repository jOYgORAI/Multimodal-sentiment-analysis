The kit comes well stocked with a nice assortment of good quality supplies. Oftentimes with kits like these, the accessories aren't very good. That is definitely not the case with this kit.

The kit includes everything needed to do simple repairs on clothing and other items (blankets, pillows, stuffed toys, etc.) While the name is Crafter's Friend, it's perfect for anyone.  I know I'll have this kit around for years to come because when the threads and buttons are used up, I can easily replenish them. I had a coupon for the kit I bought, but I won't hesitate to buy more as gifts and small prizes.Nice mini sewing kit excellent qualityNice mini sewing kit excellent qualityNice mini sewing kit excellent quality",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81H+PnmcsAL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
1,"I am a first time user of this type of finish for my artwork and craft projects, therefore I cannot compare this product to others. What I can do, though, is share my experience using it. My first attempt at using this with paper did not come out as smooth as I had wished. I ended up with a few wrinkles and bubbles, but I do not blame the product but my inexperience. I liked that the finish held to the foam brush well without dripping and smoothly covered the paper project. without leaving brush lines. A little bit went a long way, too.  My second attempt went much better. I did not put as much finish on it as I had the first time and also waited a bit for the finish to get a little tacky before I adhered the paper to the base, (Thank you You-tube!)
I used a brayer to smooth the paper once it was adhered to the base. I had very little wrinkling or bubbling. Clean up was very easy. The foam brushes, my hands and the brayer washed off easily with just water. I also like that his set came with both a matte and a gloss finish as well a 25 foam brushed. I can't  image me using them all unless I get  hooked on this type of craft finishing. I only have used the matte finish so far, and i like the look of it. The photos below were my fist two attempts. I used a canvas as the base for the project and colored card stock paper for the designs. I also printed the center design on card stock. I imagine it will be a different experience when I use napkins or thinner paper for a project.Applies smoothlyApplies smoothlyApplies smoothly",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31J6BGdXKHL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/318TvMwYRlL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
2,"With several different choices of pencils under the same listing please make sure that you read the reviews for the ones you are considering purchasing otherwise you might be disappointed. This review is for the Kenting 36 Crude (base) Wood pencils stores in a 'natural' round cylinder which includes a pencil sharpener.

The pencils themselves color well, WAY better than some of the cheaper brands out there. There is a wide variety of colors provided including a LOT of blues and green. What this set does lack is a good selection of reds. There are some nice pinks but only a couple reds. I would have liked to have seen more considering how many different blues there are! The picture I included illustrates ALL the colors bar white so it gives you a good idea of what colors you will be receiving. The pencil sharpener works well so that is definitely handy if you are outside or at the doctor's office etc. and don't have access to your electric pencil sharpener. The cylindrical box measures in at 8 3/8"" x 2 1/8"" so does not take up a lot of space.

What's not to like? The writing on the box is in a foreign language. Due to the natural wood which I do think looks great and certainly cuts down on the chemical odors that accompany some pencils, sadly it is sometimes hard to see exactly which shade of pencil you want. The name of the color needs to be stamped on the pencil.

Definite keeper in this house and definitely an ""okay"" product hence 3 stars. It means I like them but due to the ""issues"" above I am not jumping up and down going ""Wow! Wow! Wow!""

3,"I received these brushes at no cost in order to test and review them. Normally I work in watercolors, but this summer I did several oil paintings and used these brushes.

WHAT I LIKED:
* I liked the selection. These are all filberts, which are nice for soft edges. The #12 was big enough to do flat sky washes, and the smaller sizes were good for details, trees in the distance, stones buildings, etc.

* The brush quality was pretty good overall

* I washed these well and they stayed soft from week to week.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:
* Some of these had a few loose hairs
* I prefer shorter handles on the smaller sized brushes.Pretty good student brushesPretty good student brushesPretty good student brushes",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YOEkZMxGL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

5,"Jolee's stickers are almost always best-in-class for decorating greeting cards. I like to use these white and silver gem and pearl clusters for embellishing my wedding cards, which I sell to benefit our local library.

These stickers can be used singly  as the main decoration on an A2 (5.5"" x 4.25"") greeting card.  See customer image for an example of an A2 Friendship card using one of the larger stickers, plus the four single pearls at the corners of the card.  I simply peeled the stickers off of the clear plastic sheet inside the package, and stuck them to my card.  One of the pearls didn't stick very well and I had to glue it onto the card face, but that wasn't a big deal.

NOTE:  these stickers are rather bulky and will require protection if your greeting card is going to be mailed.Pretty but somewhat bulkyPretty but somewhat bulkyPretty but somewhat bulky",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516aYgIzRyL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
6,"Love the shimmery, metallic look these pens make possible!  I used the gold one for the arrows and ""cards"" writing in the photo, which will give you a feel for it.  They're fine-tipped pens, which is great for intricate fonts and other details.  Fairly easy to use, but my only gripe is that sometimes the pen sprays tiny dots of ink roughly within a 1-inch radius of where you're writing.  I think it might be more likely to do this when it's running low on ink.  The dots gave what I was working on a cool ""starry"" look, which sometimes looked great and seemed sort of intentional, but other times it looked sloppy.  If smooth wood or plastic is your surface, as opposed to paper/card stock, the dots can be corrected if you clean them up quickly with a Q-tip.  (I've used the white version of this pen on particle board and experienced the same thing).

10,"I received this item in exchange for my honest review. The package came quickly and the box is cute. The instructions on the back for making a simple paracord bracelet are easy to follow, the pictures show you everything you need to know, though I stopped reading almost immediately (spell check could have greatly helped here). Upon attempting to remove the product from the box, the end came off. It's obvious here that no screws or glue were used on this end to keep it in place as there is no debris to indicate such. I figured that the tension of making a bracelet would keep this in place anyways, more on this later. The bracelet maker is smaller and lighter than the one we purchased last year for my daughter but this is not a bad thing. Both of the buckle connectors are the same size, the smaller ones. This is fine because it's what we typically use, but it's nice having a second option available. With the plastic connectors that hold the buckles, there doesn't appear to be enough room to remove it and insert a large buckle using the same holder. I used my other paracord bracelet jig against this one and see the measurements differ slightly, though it was impossible to see which one is off...we made bracelets using the same numbers as the old jig and they fit fine, so this is a nonissue. I was a little put off by the fact that when you adjust the size, one of the legs stays put and therefore makes it appear a bit tippy, but during use I noticed I never left it on a table, it was in my lap, so the legs really didn't matter. As far as the one end not being secured, I thought that it wouldn't be an issue but twice I noticed as I was making a bracelet, it rocked back off and released. No big deal, I put it back on and the bracelet was not affected. That being said, this isn't what I would have expected when purchasing a product such as this. Also, the female buckle end that is attached to the jig doesn't fully accept the male loose buckle that you are using to make a bracelet. The prongs don't fully open inside of it, which means if you pull too hard, it will release. My daughter pointed out her more well-known jig does the exact same thing. Overall, we tested this product quite thoroughly and made several bracelets, all of which turned out great. This will make a great jig for a beginner, and the price is quite affordable.Great beginner's jigGreat beginner's jigGreat beginner's jig",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z5UIKOxqL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

15,"I love these watercolors. Considering how much use I've gotten out of them, they are definitely worth the price.

Pros: Wonderful range of colors, ranging from earthy to candy-coated, and great concentrated pigment for layering. It didn't become gooey like a lot of cheap watercolors. Super easy cleanup for that reason - even easier than most watercolors.
Cons: the waterbrush was useless after the red peg to keep it shut fell out and got lost; however, I typically didn't transport it with that brush anyways.

I've used these watercolors for a lot of daily sketches as I've done daily sketches for 143 days in a row (with the goal of 300, using the book 300 Drawing Prompts).

20,"I have made two handbags now with this yarn and left a review for the first one that I made with the green color. It took two spools to complete and I did not even check the dye lot when they arrived because I ASSUMED (yes, I know) they would send me two skeins that matched. Well, they didn't, and I did not even realize until after the project was completed that parts of the bag were not quite the same shade - very close, mind you, and most people won't notice, but it is very obvious to me.

But I liked well enough how the product works to order another two skeins in a neutral color, AND I made sure when they arrived they were the same dye lot. My second bag did not use up all of both skeins, so I still have a little left - but I LOVE the bag I made with it and the color is something I can use every day.

It is hard to call this crochet ""thread"" because I am used to using fine, doily-appropriate thread with a 1 to 2 mm hook, and this is thick enough to use a size D or F hook, so I think of it as more of a 3-ply cord. Whatever you call it, it is silky smooth going through your fingers and works up very nicely. The cut ends tend to fray, so I tie 2 knots close together and cut between them. However, the fraying can actually be useful if you want to separate the three strands to use one to thread a large-eyed needle for sewing your crocheted pieces together

If I ever want to crochet another purse, I will probably order this product again - and if you order multiple spools, just be sure they are the same dye lot before removing the wrapper.This is my second experience with IrisThis is my second experience with IrisThis is my second experience with Iris",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p7G4Y4XvL._SY88.jpg,positive,anger

 Beautiful gold shimmery watercolors. They dry smooth and have great dimension, activating them is very quick especially the more darker tones such as the Red Gold (No. 902) Personally one of my favorites! The consistency is slightly creamy, you need 50/50 of water and paint on your brush in order to get good opaque pigmentation.

Make sure to clean your brush thoroughly between the lights and darks. Along with the water, if you are using regular watercolor plus these, use different jars of water unless you want shimmery colors! To be safe, I would rinse my brush under the faucet to remove the gold particles.

You dip the brush to dampen them and then have wonderful bright pains to work with. The brush is the inexpensive basic brush you get with a kids are set, not much to send home about. The pencils are very nice. Most sets like this do not offer professional sketching pencils. I have one child I watch who is an amazing artist. I explained to her how the different numbers on the pencils correlate to hardness and how they look on paper and she flew with it. She loves having darker harder shades and softer easier to smudge shades. The pencil sharpeners are basic but I love there are two so you do not get graphite on your colored pencils and vice versa. Excellent set that will get much love here.

38,"Brother Embroidery Hoop 4x4 / B001TOY2O6

I purchased this for use with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-PE700II-Embroidery-Machine-with-USB-Port/dp/B0013J8F9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother PE700II Embroidery Machine with USB Port </a>&nbsp;- the machine comes with a large 5x7 hoop, but I found that was too big for most of my projects. Smaller pieces of cloth and clothing won't fit in the 5x7 size and while you can use the bigger hoop with small pieces (with the help of adhesive stabilizer), it seemed worthwile to invest in a smaller hoop. This hoop works perfectly with the PE700II - except for the size, it is identical to the hoop that came included with the machine. Simply unscrew the clasp to loosen the hoop, set your fabric and stabilizer face-up on top of the hoop, drop the inner hoop into place, and screw to tighten.

The 4x4 is the perfect size for most patterns and most projects. The smaller size also allows for you to save on stabilizer. Embroidering clothing items, especially for children or pets, is *much* easier with this smaller hoop. Even your average bathroom washcloth is going to be smaller than 5x7 inches, so unless you're *only* planning to embroidery large items like shirts and sheets, I definitely recommend investing in a set of smaller hoops.

Two items to note: First, this 4x4 is the medium hoop attachment for the PE700II machine and is represented as such on the LCD display when viewing patterns. When the medium hoop on the LCD display is grayed out, that indicates that the pattern is too large to use with this hoop (see the product image I've posted). If you can afford only one of the smaller hoops, I would probably recommend buying this medium 4x4 hoop over the smallest 1x2 hoop (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-SA442-Small-Embroidery-Hoop-1in-x-2in/dp/B001UAUXSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother SA442 Small Embroidery Hoop (1in x 2in)</a>) over the 1x2 hoop, just because many patterns will fall just slightly out of the 1x2 measurements and you'll need to use the medium hoop size instead. However, if you can afford both, you'll definitely get a great deal of use out of them.

Which brings me to my second note: The prices for these hoop attachments seem to vary widely and that I was able to procure it for *much* cheaper than shown here as part of a hoop set that included one of each of the four major hoop sizes for my machine. So I would recommend researching around to find the best deal, price-wise. Having said that, even at full price this hoop will likely pay for itself in no time, considering the savings in stabilizers, adhesives, and material.

The canvas is tight and wraps around the edges of the boards so you get full edge to edge coverage. The size assortment is terrific. It includes 11"" x 14"", 9"" x 12"", 8"" x 10"" and 5"" x 7"". You get six of each of those sizes. So far I have painted with acrylics, but these are ready for what ever medium you choose to use and the different sizes expand your options.
My canvases were well packaged and arrived in terrific condition with no damage.
I will have to buy some frames, but these look like they are going to frame nicely. The back of the canvases have a name plate where you can record the name of your creation, Artist;s name, medium used, signature of the artist and the date.

40,"When I purchased these crochet hooks I was so excited to get a good set of ergonomically designed hooks that would hurt my hands less than other ones do. These purport in the title to be ""soft, but sadly, there is nothing soft about them! There are several kinds of crochet hooks on Amazon that really are soft and ergonomic. These are neither, to my hands. However, I began to think about how often I use the case they came in and am revising my review.

I really dislike giving a product a down rating, but having eventually found ergonomically designed hooks that really ARE soft elsewhere, I can honestly say that these were not soft to me. However, I used several of them and decided it would be wrong to return them as I did get some use from them. And, also honestly, I love the holder they came in and am considering buying another one of those! I did NOT contact the seller as I chose not to return them nor to ask for a refund, so this is not a case of them not doing their part. The only thing I am disagreeing with is the description of soft. They are hard enough that they sound like I am tapping wood on a table when I drop them. It does come with a set of 7 hooks from C to I US designations (from 2.75 mm to 5.5mm).

If your hands are not arthritic, this may very well be a great product for you. There is a great selection of hooks in this set and they appeared to be well made. They come in a really cool case that I have used to store other hooks in for some time now.

PROS:
Well made
Really cute storage case that is also well made
Although I think $36.99 a bit pricey for this set, I will say that the case goes for around $10 separately and so this set DID meet my 1/$1 rule of craft purchases (that is one use for every one dollar spent on it). In fact, I've used just the case to store my hooks and carry them around in the car, on trips, to family events when we would be sitting around chatting (as I can crochet and talk... but not chew gum and walk). Seriously - I love the case!

CONS:
Not really soft enough to be comfortable for my hands

42,"I've had a Silhouette Curio for a little over a year, but I hadn't worked with vinyl yet. In my kit, the vinyl and transfer paper came rolled into one... I'm still not sure which is the stencil paper and which is the transfer tape... This is a great starter kit, but the I instructions could have been a little more clear.

Tips:
Cut your design out on paper first if you're unsure. Sometimes seeing the design in person makes a difference.

SCRAPE YOUR EDGES, FORCEFULLY. To get clean, crisp lines, you MUST ensure the vinyl has completely adhered to your glass surface.

Curved glass surfaces are CRAZY DIFFICULT when working with larger designs. Cut it out on paper first and treat it like a sewing pattern. Make little snips to help curves lay flat.

Reuse the etching cream! It's expensive. Slather it on, and scrape the excess back into the container.

45,"This review is for the Crafty Rabbit Premium Washi Set - Travel Vacation Collection - Decorative Bright Paper Masking Tape Rolls for DIY, Crafts, Scrapbooking, Calendar.

This is high quality washi tape that comes in a fun set of travel patterns. This set is great for decorating scrapbooks, travel books, using as packing tape on shipping boxes, and decorating many other items. I purchased this set because I collect washi and had never seen a set of travel themed tape before. This set comes with six rolls, 2 thinner rolls of the standard classic washi tape width, and 4 thicker rolls that are about double the sizing of regular tape.

The designs on these rolls is VERY intricate and detailed, and each roll is completely unique with fun colors. The overall color theme is fairly similar between the six rolls though, so decorating looks good if you combine the designs. Each roll has a TON of tape on it. I think the Amazon description says almost 33 feet long. The two widths of the tape are: 0.6 inches for the thinner designs, and 1.2 inches for the thicker rolls. The collection comes wrapped in a cellophane tube and is ready for gifting if you plan to give this to a crafting lover or washi tape collector.

The tape goes on extremely smooth, doesnt bubble and is easy to cut and lay down straight. Over time, the tape doesnt fade or become torn or peel up. This is some of the most quality washi I have worked with. I would highly recommend this brand! 5/5 stars

You can also check out Youtube videos for visual instructions on how to make all sorts of things with your origami paper.  I'm having so much fun with my daughter making all sorts of animals.

53,"Good glow to this thread, even after it's sewn. The blue is the dimmest of colors on the spool, but it's also the darkest to begin with. The picture of the sewn embroidery was taken using a black light. The tee shirt material is dark slate gray and the non-illuminated glow in the dark thread is orange when in regular light.

edit: Sept 22nd 2017 - adding photos of other projects. Patterns are from Urban Threads website. Some patterns are very thick (""Literary Magic""; the pumpkin) while others are simpler line sewing (""Dance Macabre"" skeletons). This thread works best when you have a machine that can slow down the sewing speed. I have a Brother 780D (twin to the Brother 770) that I use for glow and metallic threads. The Babylock ESE2 and Brother 8500 I own can sew these threads, but will end up with a lot of breakage due to a lack of slow sewing option on those 2 models. There are videos on youtube on how to slow down the Brother 770/780D machine speed (650 ---> 350).  Near zero breakage when running the machine slow. There is very little breakage when running at the full 650RPMs, but it needs to be watched vigilantly.Good glow to this threadGood glow to this threadGood glow to this thread",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41NZBf87LaL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qBNvqgdqL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eHerW+SxL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fOtpqJxxL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SUQF0CxgL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

Artwork: I was going for some sort of an 'spacey' type background; hope I achieved that ;-) I really had a blast working with this stencil; can't wait to use it again. Additional tools used: Tim Holtz distress inks.

Very easy to use; clean-up was a breeze -- I used water from a spray bottle and wiped with a soft cloth.

This is a great option for if you do a lot of sewing and need elastic for waistbands, or other uses.
This elastic seems like it's a nice quality, not super thin or seems like it's going to stretch out easily. The width is perfect for kid's waistbands in clothing, or you could easily use it to make headbands and other items.

56,"Fairly consistent color. To gauge. Can have an occasional ding, dent or imperfection in the coil.

Warrning:
Artistic Wire brand similar is 'yellow gold' or a gold you expect.
Beadaholique brand 'gold' is orangish. It does NOT match Artistic Wire. Looks good with warm colors though, great with red and black.
Beadaholique brand 'tangerine' is barely darker orange. Side by side very close. Just enough if you mix in a project you will see it.

Beadaholique brand has a smaller squarish lavender purple hangtag. Artistic Wire has a narrow light yellowish greenish hangtag.
So when looking at pictures of these two brands you will know if you see the ID hangtag which one you are looking at (the blacks do not match either, the finish looks different enough)

I have rolled a lot of this for making very heavy 'Fyre Wyrm' chaine maille chains. Rolling and cutting my own large diameter links then knitting roughly 1 inch wide chains. It bends fairly well, is very lightweight (about 1/3 the weight of copper or other metals) and I actually work these without pliers-it also avoids nicking or marring the finish. There is an issue when cutting the links about being very careful about not letting the jeweler's saw blade bounce or skip as it will mar up the surface.

For workability and yield, appearance, is I give five stars. Coil length is fairly consistent. The picture shown in description is a little yellower looking than the real coil shows in person. This is also a rather soft temper, if you're used to harder temper you could straighten and coil the wire a few times to work it up. IF you use pliers use nylon jaws or otherwise protect the jaws as the finish will nick up.

60,"Vivid colors but if using with color books, the hard fine point on the pens make this set ideal for tiny details, not for larger areas where the output is streaky and the work is time consuming. A couple of the colors of the ink were not a good match to the barrel so it is worth the time to create a color chart to use as a guide to avoid possibly ruining a picture or project by trusting barrel color alone..

Bleed-through is a definite problem. Paper quality will vary from one adult coloring book to another, but even on reasonably thick paper and while using light pressure, the ink bled through the back and left some ink spots on the next page. So, a two-sided coloring book will not be a good choice, and a protective sheet between pictures is a necessity.

The caps are on quite tight so if the user has issues with hand strength first gently twist them off with something like a small pair of pliers and then lightly but firmly replace so they are ready to use.

This set has been around for years for use in other types of art projects -- long before the current popularity of adult coloring books..I like the reasonable price and vibrant hues, but if used with a coloring book it is best for one-sided illustrations on tiny details.Pentel 36 Color Pen Set -- Fine Points Suitable for DetailPentel 36 Color Pen Set -- Fine Points Suitable for DetailPentel 36 Color Pen Set -- Fine Points Suitable for Detail",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jOWpGvsgL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TsOdr8qsL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

Bonus use:  I had some leftover, so I wrapped the wooden legs of a tall table that my foster cats were using for a scratching post. Instant cat heaven!  The cats all love to scratch and the legs are being protected.  The dimensions of the stool I finished is 13 x 11 x 1.5 inches and I used up about 2/3 of the roll. So I have enough to make more cat scratching posts!

The color pictured seems about right, if anything the rush I got might be a slight bit darker.Worked well to recane a stool, used extra to wrap a table leg for cat scratch post.Worked well to recane a stool, used extra to wrap a table leg for cat scratch post.Worked well to recane a stool, used extra to wrap a table leg for cat scratch post.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zycJBuwbL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

69,"This is a review of the Huhuhero Marco 72 Pack Color Pencils with Metal Tin.

Summary  I have a few sets of colored pencils of various types and these are a nice set. You get a full range of colors as none of the 72 pencil colors are the same. What I like about these is how smooth they are and how you do not need to press down hard to get a nice color. In terms of durability, to me they feel as comfortable as using a normal pencil. I would say they are a medium hardness. They are not so soft they break or leave small particles when using and yet not hard in where you have to press hard and do not get a nice solid and smooth line. The tin they sit in is nice and convenient for me. My 9 year old daughter uses these as well and based on the design, I know right away if she did not put them all away. Overall, very happy and would recommend them.
As with all my reviews, I will update this review should the pencils develop any issues with ongoing use.

Features
-These come pre sharpened and ready to use.
-Are from the Macro Raffine.
-Do a nice job with blending and using to outline accents.
-They have color ends on the top to reflect the color of the pencil. (Nice so you can see the color from either end of the pencil.)
-Each pencil is numbered. Another great way for ensuring you pick the right pencil each time. (Ex. When using very similar colors.)
-Are excellent for all types of uses from school projects, adult coloring books or even work projects.
-You get 72 colored pencils with no duplicate colors.
-These are safe, non-toxic and are made of recycled wood making them safe for the entire family and even pregnant women.
-Comes in a nice storage tin. There is an upper and lower pencil tray to organize the pencils. It has grooves for the pencils; however, they do not click in. (As noted above, great way to ensure you always grabbed all the pencils since each pencil has a place.)
-The ones sharpened were done using an electric sharpener and they did not get chewed down quickly like some pencils do.

70,"Love to paint on the grandkids every now and then!  Good brushes really help - especially when face painting isn't exactly your forte, as in my case, ha.  But I do love to give it a go, and the kids are always happy no matter how it turns out because - well because hey, it's face painting!  This brush works well for finer details and cleans up easily - pretty much all that I ever demand of a face-painting brush.

No offense whatsoever to all the marvelous face-painters out there, but when you've got 4 grandkids and they all want their face painted at King's Island and it's $20 a pop, it's nice to be able to say, why don't we go home and let NONI paint your face??  Woohoo - a good face painting kit and a few quality brushes and I save myself a bundle. :)

71,"The review for these Bright Gelatos could be summed up in one word: PERFECTION.

Since it's impossible for me to leave a review that short (seriously - I might even call myself grandiloquent...no, I wouldn't - I'd call myself a big mouth lol), I have to tell you why I find them to be totally superb. Let's talk about the color - delicious bright shades of tropical colors. These are the colors I would surround myself with in my world. I love how vivid and luscious they are.

Consistency: Like a velvety lipstick, they lay down color on every surface I've tried with splendid results. It doesn't take much to create a piece that really sings - especially when water is added. Using the included paintbrush with some water will allow you to move these yummy creams around your project with incredible ease. Adding a little water will just turn these into succulent watercolors - adding more water will allow you to achieve the ""washed out"" look that is so popular right now. (See my photo of the house I made with these.)

The included paintbrush: LOVE the quality! Usually brushes that are included with a kit (of any sort) are awful...but this one isn't. I really do ADORE it! I have used it for so many things. It's my favorite brush and I get small panic attacks when I think about how I'll get along when it's done. Hasn't lost a single hair, is firm, but not too firm, picks up the perfect amount of water...ahhh. I love this thing!

Versatility: Gelatos will work on just about any substrate you're pondering. You also have tons of options when it comes to putting them on the substrate...slice of a little and put it in some water in a spray bottle and mist it on your project. Apply directly from the tube. Use a paintbrush. Use a wet paintbrush. Use a cotton bud. A tissue. Your finger. A palette knife. Dauber. Sponge. It's late, I'm tired and not feeling creative right now - but you get the idea.

Gelatos are fantastic for experienced artists and newbies alike. They are my new favorite supply - which says a lot. (My house is like a mix of Hobby Lobby, Michael's, and Dick Blick combined....but only because I would need the square footage of all three of those stores to properly store all my supplies!)

Workable fixative seems to hold these in place, although I have to say that I haven't noticed any color change when adding another wet medium AFTER these have THOROUGHLY DRIED. I also like to use a combination of clear gesso and clear varnish (in a thin coat) to make sure everything stays the same on a prior layer, while adding some tooth for a new layer.

If you are looking for an amazing colorful supply, CLICK BUY!! What are you waiting for? Oh - and these also come with two sponge wedges (like make up applicators) - one soft and one hard. If these things would make me coffee in the morning, I would so run away with them.A Gushing Review for An Awesome SupplyA Gushing Review for An Awesome SupplyA Gushing Review for An Awesome Supply",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zdctel1SL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

83,"I debated returning this easel... This easel is incredibly lightweight (only 1 lb and 6 oz!) and fairly sturdy enough to use for most artists as long as you're not especially heavy-handed. The easel wobbles a bit when you put pressure on the support/canvas surface but a bit of give is acceptable given how light and portable the easel is.  The problem is with its maximum height. The highest possible height the lower support rail (18"" wide) raises up to is 39"", making this easel mostly a sit-down easel, not an easel for painting while you're standing up. Ths is especially true if you paint on smaller panels out in the field, but you can plausibly use a larger panel/gatorboard around 19-20"" high to raise up and tape/clip your painting surface near the top to draw/paint while standing. A very useful feature on this easel that made me consider keeping is how the support bar could be secured with the metal bracket on the vertical pole along with the use of the supplied velcro strip as you can see on my uploaded photo. I have other portable but heftier aluminum easels without this securing feature and the support rail frequently get dislodged and dropped, or the back leg can annoyingly slide out. Although the max pole height to the top of the canvas is 61"", I wouldn't raise it past 59"" to secure the vertical pole on the support rail bracket. I ultimately decided to keep the easel to paint while sitting because it is so portable and folds down to only 20 1/2"".  I would recommend this for people looking for a very lightweight portable sit-down easel, but you need a taller easel for painting while standing.Portable Sit-Down Easel.

 Prismacolor markers have beautiful color. The nibs are versatile and work well. Always use the markers before you use colored pencils, gel pens, chalk, crayon, or pastels. It will stain your nibs and possibly ruin them. Even pencil will do this if you go over a dark outline.
I have been using these markers for over 15 years, and have made some beautiful pieces of art with them. They last a long time too. I have some from my first set in the early 2000s that still work perfectly. These had more of a multiliner on one end than the ones they make these days. Now its a ""broad tip/fine tip"" but the fine tip is thicker than it used to be. Still great though since you can buy the multiliners separately.

103,"This is spefically for the one skein that I bought which is called Apple Orchards.
This yarn is seriously gorgeous. It's extremly soft and the colors are beautiful. This is easily the most lovely yarn to work with in my experience because your needle will just glide through it. It has a satin feel to it just as  described.
The changes in color within the yarn are subtle and do not produce stark stripes as seen with other yarns- at least with a granny square or a circle. Image attached. Please ignore the 'jumps' on the left, that is me accidentally and quite stupidity using dc to make a circle with multicolored yarn. But you can see how beautiful it looks.
Like another user mentioned, I too found  that the yarn does stick to itself and when ripping out stitches you have to tug and it can be hard not to cause the yarn to fuzz up. See image.
For this reason it lost a star.
I can confirm that it is indeed a worsted weight yarn (4). Edit: this actually feels more like Aran weight yarn. It is also true as some users have indicated, that the thickness varies but for me it doesn't seem to spoil the end result.
It also has a slight fuzz to it although stitch patterns are very clear regardless. The fuzz does not get in the way at all.
However you have to think carefully about what you plan to make with it- particularly with this colorway. It's very dramatic and has a visible sheen to it. It is not matte as it appears to be in pictures or even when you look at the skein in real life. Once it is worked up the shine really shows.
 The colors are very, very vivid. I cannot stress this enough. They are jewel tones rather than thoes found in nature  and are very intense. It's absolutely stunning but personally I don't  see myself wearing anything made with it, not even a scarf. Perhaps it would work for an afgan or even a fun sweater for a toddler. Edit: I am making a yarn bag with it and am waiting for more yarn to finish it. I have included an image of it so far. It has white yarn in it, hence the white holes

This yarn is lovely so I will probably try a more suble color way for a scarf or hat.
In a nutshell I recommend this yarn as a true treat! Just don't keep changing your mind about the project ( which I do a lot) because ripping out will ruin the yarn.Beautiful but not without issuesBeautiful but not without issuesBeautiful but not without issues",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lC9K7qhmL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81u8yPdKzpL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OIgIk0tjL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

119,"So, I loved the design but not the price.  My desires got the better of me however and I took the leap and hit the add to cart button and I am glad I did!  First off, Amazon offered a used die for considerably less and it worked like a brand new die for a lot less cash.  The original packaging was missing but it did not matter to me.  THEN the big question - can it be used on a Sizzix Big Shot Pro machine?  Happily the answer is yes!  It does need a shim because it is a fraction thinner than a Sizzix die, but I just used a piece of a USPS flat rate box cardboard and it was perfect.  I was able to get a clean cut on both wool and wool felt.  Outstanding!  This design has so much potential it is truly a great die.  The die itself is narrow because it cuts one half the design on a pass.  This is actually beneficial rather than cutting the entire design all at once because there is less fabric waste, and much easier to cut color variations.  Overall I love this die.  It is expensive but well worth it from a time saving aspect.  Bottom line is this - it is a great die that will work on a Sizzix machine.  Note:  the photo I have attached is from the internet, it is not my work but an outstanding example of the potential of this die.Yes, it works on a Sizzix cutting machine!Yes, it works on a Sizzix cutting machine!Yes, it works on a Sizzix cutting machine!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61s6p1ZqazL._SY88.jpg,positive,surprise

123,"I have never really crafted with burlap before but this has me excited to venture out and try some new things! I received the Richcraft Burlap Fabric Roll at no cost to review and I am seeing potential all over the place for this! I have seen some gorgeous wreaths made with burlap and this would be perfect to dress up the front door. I belong to a fiber guild and we make a lot of different things from all kinds of fiber materials. I am definitely going to try some of the techniques I have learned there.

I have a wood top dining table I am refinishing and when it's done I want to cut a longer piece of the burlap and either paint it or use thread to decorate it. this would look great to use for almost anything from photo frames to rustic wedding decor. The roll is 12 inches wide by 10 yards long so there is quite a lot. Enough to do a really big project and lots of smaller ones! I had not seen large burlap like this before. I had seen smaller ribbon spools of it, but not this larger size. I love the range of options you get with rolls like this.

The burlap did have a slight odor when I first removed the plastic that was wrapped tightly around it, but it quickly dissipated. It is very easy to cut with scissors. And on the cut edges I simply pulled a few of the strands so there would be matching fringe on both ends. Since I have never really worked with burlap, I have not got a lot to go on for comparision, but this does look and feel like good quality to me. I was afraid when I cut it, it would start coming apart but it didn't. I actually thought it would be stiff and hard to work with but it isn't.

125,"I received my Prizm today, and I love it! I'm including a photo of the Prizm next to a water bottle to show the size -- it is TINY! I'm also including a photo of my first cuts, some tiny alpha dies. I cut the letters from watercolor paper (140lb) and the cuts were crisp and clean. This is a SMALL, light-duty die cutting machine. Compared to my Sizzix Big Shot, this machine is very lightweight and ""feels delicate"", if that makes sense. It needs to be treated gently, and the ""die cutting sandwich"" is different here -- the order is base plate, then cutting die with cutting edge UP, then paper, then one cutting plate on top. This machine will NOT emboss with folders -- only dies that also emboss (I did experiment with a border folder and multiple configurations of sandwiches, no luck). I did cut and emboss with a tiny Christmas tree die from the Spellbinders kit of the month (see photo). After cutting, I replaced the cutting plate with the brown embossing mat and blue embossing plate, ran it through only once, and the embossing is crisp and clean. The plates are 6 1/4"" x 2 5/8"" and fit perfectly in the pen caddy that was already on my desk. Plus they are adorable! For my purposes, this is a fabulous machine. I have my Big Shot and Grand Caliber for bigger/heavier/wider work, but I needed a small convenient machine for quick small die cuts that I tend to put off doing because it's such a pain to get my bigger machines out. It is NOT a replacement for a big die cutting/embossing machine, but for quick light-duty cutting and die embossing, it's a great value. One more tip, the book that is included (Read The Book!) suggests flipping over the cutting plate each time, so the wear is evenly distributed on both sides. This is good advice for any die cutting machine. Just be gentle with this little fella! If you feel resistance when rolling it through, pause and make sure your sandwich is correct. You won't be able to ""force it through"" the way you can sometimes with the Sizzix. This is a great buy for the specific purpose of light-duty cutting and die embossing.Love this!

129,"I purchased the Michley LSS-505 for $39.00 in August, 2016 for personal clothing use. I've been wanting to get a functional sewing machine while keeping the cost as low as possible.

What type of sewing I hope to achieve:
Tops and lightweight bottoms, take in medium weight jean legs, put together medium weight curtains, pillows as needed.

Testing Day One : So far I have taken in several lightweight cotton tops and the legs on a medium weight denim jean.

My initial reaction to seeing the machine was concern that it would not be able to handle denim. It's very lightweight. I did work on taking in the legs of some medium weight denim jeans today and found it very successful. I changed loosened the tension just a little because the denim I was using had some stretch to it and I wanted the stitches to have room to stretch a little as well as to keep the material from puckering. My jeans look great and it took just about ten minutes. I am happy that this little machine seems to be able to handle more than just lightweight crafts.

I'm going to include so many pictures because those always help me when looking at reviews. The machine can be battery or cord powered. There is a pedal and there is a button on the front that can be switched on low/off/hi to run the machine. It seems like it would be difficult to run this without the pedal. The reverse switch has to be held down to engage. I didn't find it difficult to use. The machine has a small built in light. I hadn't noticed that it did and was happy about that. I have noticed that the light flickers when I first press down the pedal, which can be distracting if I'm sewing short sections at a time.

130,"So the important thing to know about this product is that your rating is definitely going to vary based on what you need / expect from it.

To me, the ideal market is teachers and parents who need a lot of different colors for projects like banners and posters but who want something a bit more durable than paper (and don't need something as durable or expensive as fabrics).  I would also consider this useful for in art journals and other mixed-media types of projects.

The biggest negative for this product is that it is thin, as in see-through thin (I will try to attach an image to this review showing the white on top of the black. Obviously for the colors in between the effect is a bit more subtle, but I want you to know what to expect of this product).  For some this could be a bonus, especially if layering pieces.  It does allow for interesting effects.  But if you are going for a solid where you don't want anything to show through then you may find this is not for you, or you may have to layer multiple pieces of the same color.  I've seen it described in other reviews as being about the texture of fabric softener sheets and find that to be a very accurate description.

Because the transparency of the white sheets is so obvious, I decided to trace a drawing I had done onto the sheet. I'll attach two pictures to the review. One image is a close up to show that yes there is a texture, so if you need something smooth, this is not for you.  And then a wider shot showing that from a distance it's not that big of deal.  I used different products on it.  In the images I am attaching the main outline is a standard drawing pencil, the red is a marker, the skin is a watercolor, and the darker black outlines are a different brand of marker. All worked well.

This does not tear easily but can be cut easily.

133,"I got a Cricut machine a few months ago and I love to label things in vinyl now.  I thought I would use it more for card making or scrapbooking, nope- cutting vinyl is my favorite!  When I saw this package of vinyl colors, I knew I had to have it.  There are so many different colors that I just couldn't pass it up.  There are glossy and matte finishes, as well.  The vinyl cut beautifully and was easy to take the centers out of the letters that I didn't need.  Using clear Contact paper as transfer paper, I was able to very easily pick up the image and transfer it to the water bottle I wanted it on.  The sticky stuff sticks really well and has lasted through at least 3-4 hand washings in the sink.  This stuff isn't coming off anytime soon!  I will definitely buy this again when I need more!

134,"As much as I love artistic drawings and watching artist as they create them, I sadly don't have so much as an artistic hair on my body.  Despite not being able to draw but so hot, I do however still enjoy the attempts I will sometimes get to make at being my creative self.  Having the option to simply spruce crafty projects up by putting my own flare into them is certainly a great thing.  I ended up happening upon this set of 60 gel pens, and my mouth almost watered when I was given the opportunity to give them a try at a reduced price for my sincere opinion.  Not often do you come across a gel pen set that has so many different color options.  There are some metallics, glitters, pastels, standard deep colors, and even a few mixed colors as well.  All the pens are nicely laid out in what I like to call the plastic shelves inside the case allowing for quick and easy viewing to decide on which color will work best with your current project.  I love using gels on black paper because it just looks really nice and makes the image and letters pop beautifully.  I have a number of thank you cards that need to be sent out soon, and I am looking forward to using these for the handwritten notes and drawings on the in and outside of the cards.  I really enjoyed testing these out, and even had a youngster that ended up borrowing them for a quick assignment for school.  They absolutely loved the color options just as I did, and I really appreciated the smoothness of the pen's writing as well.  These pens are very cost effective in comparison to other options I have seen out there, and all you need to do is be sure to keep the tops on them when not in use so there is no opportunity for them to dry out.  I haven't had any negative issues with them, and can't wait for the next crafty project.

142,"This is an update to my original review
.
I've been using my pencils a LOT since I got them and have found some things that make using them better. First, the good sharpener is important to make them last a long time. The high quality one I got here on Amazon makes the sharpened area shorter, at a higher angle, so the points are short and there is less wood exposed, less frequent sharpening needed. First, the pencils ARE numbered, 501 to 572. I made a color chart on a piece of regular white paper, with a scribble of each pencil color and wrote the corresponding number beside it, so I can refer to it when making color choices. I put it inside a notebook page protector.

Second, when I use them, if the point is sharp, I use it to color in fine/small areas, and move on to larger areas as it gets worn down, thus saving how often it gets sharpened. Ditto for a dull pencil point, use it until you absolutely have to sharpen it for small areas. I find one turn of my super-duper sharpener is all it takes to get a new point. That's very economical.

I also discovered there is a great way to get them to blend nicely in places you want shading. Because they are waxy, the paper surface can only take on so much color before it's too slippery for additional layers of color to adhere to it. BUT, the trick is to layer on your blending colors a little at a time, light layers of each color, until the paper is saturated with full color. I've done some really gorgeous stuff that way, butterfly wings, flowers, and animals with tiny pattern details. Highly detailed coloring pages are my preference. ALWAYS start with the less saturated color before the more saturated. Like a pale yellow should be put on first in the area being blended, then the darker color/s after that. That way you get the right amount of the light color put on and it doesn't get overwhelmed by the stronger color/s.

AND, when doing a pattern, like a narrow row of a light background color with small dark red dots in it, put on the darker colors FIRST, so they adhere in depth, THEN draw the light color/s over/around them.

These are great pencils for the price, I'm really happy with them! It just took me some investigation and close observation to figure out how to get the best results with them. They seem to be lasting a long time, I've done boatloads of coloring with them already, but the way I use them and sharpen them makes them go a long ways, longer than for other reviewers, obviously..
*****************************

Ok,

So many reviews complain about buying this brand of colored pencils from various sellers here on Amazon, thinking they're getting various brands, but they all got the same Marco Raffine brand and felt ripped off. Nope, if the sales photo shows the same gray box, the silver-gray pencils with the same colored butt ends, you're getting the same pencils. So, shop around and get them for the lowest price from whichever seller you want, but don't order those that ship direct from China. Several reviews said they arrived broken or damaged. Stick with one that ships from Amazon directly and has already made the boat trip from China in pallets and shipping containers where they get less bashing around.

Now, I wanted lots of colors to choose from when coloring in my mandalas and etc., that I print out from adult coloring books I download with Kindle Unlimited, but I don't need the end-all and be-all of super artist-quality at a hefty price. Good value for ""decent"" quality is just fine. And these pencils fit the bill perfectly. They go on waxy, hold a point well, and make coloring fun to do all evening. They don't smear or rub off if I rest my hand on a an already colored in area while coloring one close by it. I use the best makeup pencil sharpener available for purchase on Amazon, costing a bit over $10, and it doesn't break off the pencil leads and points as I sharpen them, so I feel pretty certain that any complaints of these pencils not sharpening well, or frequently breaking off while being sharpened, are due to using a low-quality sharpener. And you don't turn the pencil in the sharpener, you turn the sharpener around the pencil, carefully. Go to the beauty/makeup section here on Amazon and look for that silver, all-metal, round little sharpener that has the replaceable blades. Worth every penny of it's higher price!

Some people have complained that there are many shades very close to each other, and they wish they had more or better shades to choose from. Well, I hate to sink your boat/s, but there are only so many shades in between the primary, secondary and tertiary colors that our eyes can easily see. If you want 5 shades in between green and yellow, there are only so many to be made. AND I know from my professional work of the past 18 yrs, that plenty of average folks don't have much sensitivity to color values - lots of people can't see the differences between burgundy and dark browns, and brandy, for instance. I find the shades of colors in this pencil set to be more than adequate and satisfactory.

If you want the super-duper artist pencils, then go order a different brand and pay the  additional $ they cost. But for the average coloring book lover, these work great! As far as saturation/depth of the various colors not being equal, I know for a fact that various colors are created by differing pigments, and these vary in saturation values and solubility in the pencil lead matrix as a matter of course. I dye lots of my own handspun yarns and many fibers for handspinning using professional acid dyes, and the pigments in them vary due to their molecular structures and how they dissolve in the dye bath and then penetrate into the fibers. I think it's the exact same thing with pencils, so if the daisy yellow color on your page has more depth, and the cornflower blue doesn't, well, it's not necessarily due to crummy pigments in them. And if you want a deeper saturation of the color/s, don't try to achieve it by pushing down harder with the pencil. Instead, go over the area 2 or 3 times, with normal pressure and it will look fine. I usually color in the area with my strokes going back and forth in one direction, then the next layer/s I put on with soft strokes moving in small smushy circles to get even coverage. If you're pushing down so hard that you're breaking off points and tips, then you're doing it wrong, and it's not the pencils' fault!

My only criticism, which is minor, is that the box they come in isn't good for keeping them in while I'm using them. I just dumped them out into a long, but small box that I keep on my lap, and I color ALL the sections I want to be one certain color at once, or maybe have out the 3 or 4 colors I'm going to use in a particular section, to avoid confusion.

So, to recap, I find these pencils very satisfactory, for my purposes. You get lots of colors, at a very good price. I'm not writing this review having gotten this set for free or at a discount, I can say what I want to say, up front. I looked into that and my review would be limited to nothing but writing ok things and having to stifle or minimize mentioning anything I didn't like about them to ""keep my review respectful"". Kinda like being on an online forum with heavy moderation, so you can't ever really speak your mind and all you're allowed to do is blandly agree or keep silent.Great pencils and variety of colors for the price!Great pencils and variety of colors for the price!Great pencils and variety of colors for the price!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Mip+-bpHL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ks5-MAVKL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71me19xkfSL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718FxkB1PDL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

146,"These are very bright paints! The twelve acrylic paints are medium bodied and I thinned them quite a bit with glazing fluid for using layers. The colors are absolutely fantastic. They are moderately translucent in thinner layers, so they aren't as solid as some but that's okay as it makes blending fun. They are medium drying which is awesome. Nobody like their palette to be dry in ten minutes, right? But one of the perks of using acrylics is the fact they dry a lot faster than oils. These are definitely craft paints,and good for small crafts or painting projects they will work awesome for that.

148,"I am a beginner knitter and wanted to purchase a set that would include a variety of needle sizes and cords.  I was happy to discover this set at Michaels but the price was a little steep,  but of course after a quick search on Amazon I found the price much more reasonable that retail.

The set comes with 12 needle sizes and 5 cord sizes.  I actually only utilize one cord which is the 16"" as I primarily knit cable knit beanies for the winter season.  When making these I prefer circular needles as it is easier for me to just continuing around until I begin decreasing and changing to double pointed needles to close off the beanie.  I find I make beanies quicker using the circular needle method rather than traditional needles and as I am not an expert at joining in the end (my joins end up quite obvious) I definitely love the fact you cannot tell where the beginning and end is using these circular needles.  I actually purchased a spare replacement Clover 16"" cord on Amazon so I could have two projects going on at the same time if I wanted to have a little variety at times.  I absolutely love the fact that the replacement cords are readily available for separate purchase as it makes the investment of this set more satisfying.

The quality of the needles are exceptional.  They are bamboo which makes it very lightweight compared to metal ones offered in other sets.  I prefer the bamboo material for needles as it grips the yarn - it has less slippage than metal needles- which makes it easier as a beginner knitter for its disheartening when you accidentally drop your stitches when placing your work down for a moment.  I find the bamboo needles easier for me to have a equal tension and uniformity in knitting as well so my rows are not too tight or too loose.  If perhaps you are a more experienced knitter who likes speed I think you may be a little slowed by the bamboo needles gripping the yarn.

I often have to interchange needles in beanies and find it very easy to do so with this set.  When making beanies the pattern often calls for smaller needles for the ribbing portion such as in a fold over beanie and then a switch to larger needles for the remainder of the beanie.  The only problem I have had has been with the metal joints securing the needles.  They are a very smooth transition as my yarn doesn't get caught on it at all; however, when knitting for many rows I find the metal joints slowly unscrewing themselves.  I always am expecting this as it has always happened so I always make sure to tighten and re screw these joints every so often.  I still feel this is an amazing set despite this problem as the pros definitely outweigh this minor nuisance.Lightweight and smooth - easily interchangeable but does screw off at metal joint after knitting a whileLightweight and smooth - easily interchangeable but does screw off at metal joint after knitting a whileLightweight and smooth - easily interchangeable but does screw off at metal joint after knitting a while",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CMWaS54UL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7151aIM7ZXL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pV9aj5BrL._SY88.jpg,positive,sadness
149,"The X3000 model is nearly identical to the current X2000 blade handle. The only difference is that it is slightly longer and has a twist off cap beneath which you can store up to 5 #11 blades. It can be purchased for about 50 more than the X2000 model, and IMHO, it is worth it for the added utility and the fact that it comes with 3 spare #11 blades (see photo). Mechanically, in the hand, and in action -- the X2000 and X3000 are essentially the same thing. I'm not a huge fan of the rubber grip material being used on the newer production models, but the rubber on my old model has started to get ""tacky"" so while mechanically it is still sound, it is time to get a newer model. The X2000/3000 is still the best knife I've ever used in my art and graphic design career for precision cutting.

175,"These watercolours took almost 4 weeks to get to me in the Caribbean. I finally got them however. The seller packaged the box in a tight cardboard box apparently without bubble wrap so that the watercolour brand box packaging was a bit squashed when it came to me. The  palette was fine though as it is made from fairly sturdy plastic. The watercolours are so bright and rich in colour and easily rewetted. I can't wait to start painting with them. Some of the colours are more opaque and some much more transparent. I use Holbein paints now but these ones seem more vivid.

These are great for serious students and artists who want to work in watercolour with good tools. This set can teach you about the property of different pigments and colour mixing. This can also be used for work that you want to reproduce because the colours are quite vivid. I wasn't sure how lightfast the colours are but I found some lightfastness ratings and the pigment used on the wrapper of the pans. I don't know a lot about this brand so if you want to be sure you could use brand with more documented lightfastness ratings like Winsor & Newton, Senneiler, Schmincke, Maimeriblu etc. Having said that these are pretty easy to work with and come in a nice plastic case - which I think is the same one the large Cotman set comes in.

177,"I don't regret theses at all! Now it took a bit to learn how to use these so let me save you some time. These are more background watercolors/writing beautifully with watercolor to stay in the same media. In the picture I put up you can see the green and gray which are these  watercolor brush pens. These pens don't blend well but the pigment sure moves but I recommend going at these with more of a color pencil style that you plan to blend. What I mean is you want to work from the darker areas first and spread it out because sometimes the pigment is absorbed so well into the paper the original line will remain transparent in the background through the lighter watercolor. You can really see that in the Easter Egg card with the gold background.

I tend to go over the background watercolor with either color pencil or watercolor pencil (working in layers)

These pens don't come marked so I highly recommend you leave them in the order that they arrived and make a color sample for your own reference. My own sheet is not equal in size square if squares but you can see the difference in the amount of pigment willing to move on cold press watercolor. I have had these markers for 6 months, none of my arrived dried out. They still work as good as I got them but I do make sure I double snap the close, it is very easy not to fully cap these markers. If you just keep putting them back in the case, you will know if they don't fit that they are no closed.

178,"I'm a starter painter and have learned first hand it is easier to work with acrylics than oils. Acrylics are easier to mold, dry faster and are easier on brushes! The variety of colors is nice for a beginner and the quality seems good enough, at least for a starter. It took 48 hours to dry which wasn't an easy wait for someone as impatient as me, and required a place for it to dry. If you are considering these for children, be forewarned, after painting, you will need to find a place far from little hands to leave them for up to two days to dry, otherwise it'll get messy!

I purchased a simple starter set of brushes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loew-Cornell-Brush-Set-Value-Pack/dp/B000U68YJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loew-Cornell Brush Set Value Pack</a>&nbsp;that I'm very happy with. It took  more than a half hour to try to clean my brushed up, and I still couldn't get rid of the color. Eventually I used a sponge brush (after getting tired of having to clean the bristles), and I couldn't clean those out either. Bottom line, buy a set of brushes just for oils, and perhaps use some brush cleaners (I just used soap).

If you know how to use oils, have no problem with drying time or brush cleaning, these are a nice oil paint set. Good variety of colors and enough to cover 20 8x10 canvases (I only use a light layer). They're a great starter set for anyone moving on from acrylics or watercolors but if you are a total novice to painting, I would suggest starting with acrylics, then watercolors and then oil. Happy painting!

Update: Second time around, I purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reeves-24-Tubes-Oil-Color-Tube-Set-10ml/dp/B00E9KI842/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reeves 24-Tubes Oil Color Tube Set, 10ml</a>&nbsp;instead of this and I am much happier with the new ones. The colors and selection of this set are great, but the tubes aren't secure and they leaked oil into the can I keep them in, it was a headache to clean out. I also noticed that the little stickers that indicate the paint colors are held on with a weak adhesive that came off within a few days making its a pain to differentiate the colors. To open each tube, you need to turn the cap upside down and screw it into the closed tube, this is messy and leaves the paint on the cap which is the only real way I can tell what color the tube contains, but does make a mess wherever you store it. I'd recommend Reeves for frustration-free tubes, it's worth the extra price ( and the extra star).Good Variety & QualityGood Variety & QualityGood Variety & Quality",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81m36+F3JqL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ik7e0QTnL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pPahSB3CL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BFSaCSe2L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713EjXdoLxL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

192,"Four and a half stars because I feel like the set could perhaps have been better curated. I was really looking for an intro set that contained the CMY primaries, but they don't seem to sell one that way. It's been ages since I used artist acrylic, and these were a good deal, and I thought I'd try out the RYB(G) set until I could lay hands on other colors. Also, the product description up there is lacking some punctuation. This set includes six paints:
1 - Naphthol Red Light
2 - Hansa Yellow Medium
3 - Ultramarine Blue
4 - Permanent Green Light
5 - Mars Black
6 - Titanium White
All of these paints are transparent except the black (naphthol red is about halfway on the number scale, but it still appears quite transparent to me).

Well.  I like the paint. The paint is great. It's just that the palette you get from these colors is ... a little dull. They are all pretty, vibrant colors on their own, but I painted a color wheel to test out the mixing, and anything that mixed with the ultramarine (so shades of green and violet) just didn't do it for me, even though the blue itself is lovely. The greens have an olivey tone, and the violets are a bit heavy. I suppose that's why the perm. green was included, but doesn't explain the lack of violet.

I'll use them for sure, anyway, I'll just be looking to sooner pick up the CMY palette than if I'd been happier with the mixes I got with this set. I'm not sure what other manufacturers use as their ""accepted"" set of RYB primaries -- if this is a common one or if there is variance between them. I know Golden has put out a few different sets for different aims: a landscape set, a traditional set, etc. I hoped this one would be well-rounded enough to give me a wide range.

TLDR: Great paints. Good deal to try out artist acrylic. Not the greatest gamut by itself.4.54.54.5",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Idi9EHO4L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FaoqbC0hL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
193,"These tools are extremely nice upon arrival. They are so sharp they can easily handle any task and the grip is awesome and the blades are covered with rubber coating so that you can protect sharp blade from accidental damage.
I used these tools to carve my ""chaos eater"" sword replica and it was a 1.13 m length pine wood sword with some awesome engravings but some chisels broke of tiny tips of their sharp bevel and when such thing happens you can no longer comfortably peel of the wood chips as before. Rounded bevels became dull the first, maybe because I used them a lot. Then i switched to straight ones and finalized the carving and if the blades remained as sharp as they were before I would give it a 5 star without second thoughts.
So if you buy these chisels do make sure that you have some proper sharpening equipment and honing material, because I tried to sharpen them at 400 grid wet stone and although i reached some level of sharpness they were not as sharp as initially. I guess I must try sharpening stones which have 4000 and 8000 grid and diamond stones are the best what I've heard so far.
Anyway, if you can handle sharpening, these babies are quite cool.

-use an extra piece of paper as a shim (I used my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CottageCutz-Universal-Shim-Plate-Die-Cuts/dp/B00DV8XPAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CottageCutz Universal Shim Plate Die Cuts</a>)

-use a piece of wax paper between the die and cardstock

-run your 'sandwich' through the machine one or two additional times to get a full cut

I performed all of these steps and got a clean cut using 80 lb card stock.  You'll need plenty of patience when cleaning this die of all the little leftover hearts.

I don't understand why Spellbinders doesn't put a cutting edge around the outside of the Cascading Hearts die.  You will have to cut the outside edge by hand.

The frame die cuts a background rectangle that just fits onto an A2 (5.5"" x 4.25"") greeting card.

My only point of discontent is that the top row will come out if I don't hold the top fold and flip quickly to open the case (or vice versa to close.) The work around would be a zipper which would add to the cost and the bulk, neither of which would make me happy. So I make sure to only open it on a flat surface.

As for those that comment that the stitching isn't complete, I'd send it back. These cases have a lifetime guarantee on workmanship and all of my labels are knitted neatly and completely.

Because when I would get asked if I had a ring in a certain size I knew I did but couldn't remember which ones were all that size. So that is when I knew I needed to get a ring madrel to help me out plus this set comes with the ring tool to help people see what size they need for their fingers.

It is well made plus works great it has helped me to organize my rings into the right sizes for men and woman so know when I go to display them at home shows or vendor events they will all be set up. I had to always hold some back due to not knowing because didn't want to tell a person it was one size when it wasn't.

So if you need a mandrel or ring sizer this one works great and will help you to get the job done will work when it comes to wedding rings, ordering online, or anything else you will need to know your ring size for.

205,"I bought the set of primary pens and two sets of color tops for adult coloring. While these pens are amazing in what they can do, I did not like them for coloring at all and would not recommend them to other colorists who color intricate, small space, pages.

The brush end is like any other brush pen end in size or shape and is replaceable which is great. The marker end though is not a fine liner, it's huge and thick and will not get in small spaces or do details in adult coloring books.

The blending/shading aspect is nice, but unpredictable and not for small shapes or details. The lightening of the original color is determined by how long the blender or a color top is in contact with the nib. A second will change the whole color. This might be hard to describe, but say you want a green to blue gradient to fill in a petal of a flower design that is one inch long and half an inch wide. There is no way to tell how long to have the two colors touch to achieve this. With other pen types you can color one end of that petal green and the other end blue and then merge them in the middle. Not so with these pens. I'm attaching a photo from the instructions showing you what various time amounts will give you and you can see that to get blends you'd need to be working on large, open spaces, not small detailed spaces as in all of my coloring books. Look at all the photo's other reviewers have posted in their reviews and you'll notice very little blending or shading in small areas, it's only in large spaces.

You also cannot go back over what you have done. If you miss a little spot three strokes back, you can't go back and fill it in as you are now in another shade/color. Not only that, but if you're trying to fill in a one inch design with that blend and you hit the final color at a half inch instead, there is no way to go back and fix that. In some of the other reviewers finished pages you can see a distinct line rather than a smooth gradient where it appears they have gone back and then ruined their gradient.

You also must color in one direction and one direction only. Your blend will go from light to dark, so you can't go over what you've done or color in another direction or in circles or such. You must color in a straight direction.

Yes, they bleed through every book I tried them in, so there is no way to use them in a coloring book that has images on both sides.

Another thing I found extremely annoying was the amount of pieces/caps you have to deal with. Again, this might be hard to explain. If you want a blue to purple blend you'll end up dealing with six loose things/caps. The first thing you do is remove the top blender/color. Then you have to remove the cap over the tip you want to use....so you're now holding three things, the blender tube, the pen itself and the cap from the end you plan on using. Now, get the color you want to blend with and repeat....now you've got six things laying in front of you. I color in bed so caps go in my lap which really mean they roll off me onto the bed and then if a cat moves they're on the floor.

And my last irritation was how all the above slow you down. I color detailed images which take a minimum of five hours, some up towards ten hours, to color, blend, shade and highlight. With these pens, all that uncapping and recapping, plus having to hold two nibs together and count out seconds, is an incredible waste of time....and as my choice in coloring books is small intricate designs, you have to do that over and over and over again for even the smallest of spaces.NOT for adult coloring of small, intricate, designsNOT for adult coloring of small, intricate, designsNOT for adult coloring of small, intricate, designs",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PA0reShiL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

208,"I got these metallic marker pens by Dainayw for my daughter who is interested in modern calligraphy with its casual flowing and unrestrained form.  (I took close up photos of the pen tip and the colors on white and black backgrounds.  Let me know if you find this helpful.)

These pens seem pretty similar to some expensive big name brand brush pens that many people are using for calligraphy.  These brush like pens are soft enough to get the thick and thin lines with changes in pen pressure.  The ink flows evenly and dries quickly so she doesnt smear.

Some pens seem to have more metallic color than others.  With the pink and gold pens you don't see as much variation in the color but they are solid metallic.  The other colors have more of a separation in the color and the metallic color which gives the strokes more dimensional detail.  White doesnt show up on white of course.  On black paper, the black metallic didn't show up so well which didn't surprise me.  The white goes on clear but turns ghostly white when it dries.  Although the colors are vivid on the black paper and pretty, I think the metallic shows up better on white.

This is NOT masking tape and it is NOT regular width washi tape.  It is super skinny  - just over 1/4"", and the roll is 16 feet long.

Washi tape has a bit of the look/finish of wax paper and is very thin/tears easily.

It sticks well but also peels off easily if you need/want to remove it.  The shades are all muted pastels.

222,"This is one or the neatest items I have ever used. It is a strip of plastic that can be heated in warm water and then molded like playdough. As soon as it cools it solidifies and becomes a strong piece of plastic.

Heating it up takes maybe 20 seconds and the plastic doesn't actually get hot so it won't burn your fingers. Another really good thing is that you can visually tell when the plastic is soft because it turns clear. Like, crystal clear.

I have a plastic kitchen for my toddler and there was a problem where the door was broken and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. This was a life saver.. It took a couple of minutes and voila!

Also, my dog chewed up one of my daughter's toys and I was able to melt some plastic and shove it into the cracks to fix it. So many uses, such a great thing to have around the house. I am glad I was given it for free in exchange for my testing and review because otherwise I never would have tried it out.Household necessityHousehold necessityHousehold necessity",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WJP0qMI0L._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
223,"I am adult who recently has become addicted to coloring in some of the wonderful adult-themed complex books and pages that are available. In addition, I am the nurse at a high school and have an ""anxiety"" group whose members really get a lot of stress reduction from the act of coloring while engaged in talking and listening to music. So, in this pursuit, I've used a wide variety of coloring materials from cheap dollar store pencils to high end markers. These are definitely superior to the cheap sets!

When you first open the box and see the 2 levels of vibrant color and the nice sharp tips (one of the pencil's tips was broken in transit), you can tell that these will last longer and will provide you with a great variety of color shades for everything from flesh tones to jewel tones including a gold and silver (no shimmer). The color range of the 48-color set was #501-572 with obvious gaps as this set did not have but 48 pencils. The core of the pencil was on the softer side and the color was easy to shade from lighter to darker with pressure. The product page says the color is waterproof but I have not tested this. The pencils are nicely shaped for comfort and are made of recycled wood. The ends are capped so they can only be sharpened from one end. I used a basic sharpener as needed and did not experience any of the splintering common with cheaper pencils.

One of my favorite things about this set is the roll pencil case/pouch that has slots for all 48 pencils. You can open it up and see all the colors at a glance and get to them easily. I like having this organized and the case allows you to view all the colors and also to protect the tips when storing instead of having to cram them back into a cardboard box. It makes them easy to take with you when traveling.

My students and I love this set, and perhaps I will later share some of their completed coloring pages. I received this set for free for my objective review and evaluation and I can definitely recommend them to anyone who likes using colored pencils for artwork.Quality worth paying for!Quality worth paying for!Quality worth paying for!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719IhexYM+L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Vz9hGpcOL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
224,"This is a high-quality product. The pigment is incredibly rich, way better than I expected, and the colors are vibrant.

I decided to try these, and I'm very happy with them! The colors are clearly marked on each tube, they aren't pasted on, but printed on the plastic while the other set has a small label (with weak adhesive) with color name on each that really made it hard to identify the colors. The others paints also leaked and made a huge mess in the container I placed them in, which was a pain to clean. These are well-sealed and do not leak. A spot of oil comes out of every tube when used for the first time, but otherwise, the are not messy or oily.

The selection of colors is very good, similar to the first paint set. My only problem with the color choices is that there isn't enough green which makes it rather hard to get various bright colors after the white runs out (and boy does in run out quick). I suggest purchasing a supplementary tube of white paint to help with that problem. With enough white, the colors are great allowing for you to mix nearly any shade you like. The quality of these paints is very good and easy to use. Overall, I really like this set and will be buying another when I run out.

242,"I purchased this small set of Pitt artist pens several months ago on the advice of a designer who said that the ink would not leak through on coloring books.  While I found that to be true of her particular books, I have also found that these pens do still leak through some paper and it is important to test them before using them.  I am torn about buying the larger set of 60.  I do use these in all of tests for coloring book reviews but I have only recently picked them up to do a complete design.  I'm not sure if that is because of the more limited range of colors in this small set or because I prefer other medium.

I like them for areas where I want a more solid color versus the translucent quality I get from alcohol or water based markers though I feel that the color comes across rather streaky.  That is mostly likely due to my use of the pens.  I feel that they are really more of an artist's pen than a coloring book pen.  I have used them in small patches where I wanted their deep color and have been pleased with them for that purpose.

When you first receive your beloved Glaze pens, each one has a small plastic seal on the tip of the nib. Simply pull it off, and follow the instructions on the package. You may want to ""get your pen going"" on a scratch piece of paper, but I didn't really find this necessary. As stated, to achieve a raised effect, slowly move the pen, to get a nice ink flow. Don't rush! You can also achieve some really interesting, and pretty color combinations, by mixing inks, before they dry, which is about 20 seconds. To REALLY dry, I suggest a minute, if you have a heavy amount of ink.
I have thoroughly enjoyed the Glaze pens, and have just gotten started!!! They have so many applications!

The only issue I had with them was learning how to get them started off the spool.  There is either a single thread by itself going across the spool to the bottom or in some cases there was a little bitty thread sticking out at the bottom to start the spool.  I'll admit, I messed up a couple spools trying to figure it out at first, but once I figured out the single thread down to the bottom, I got a straight pen and picked that thread up and away we went! If you're trying to decide to buy this pack for embroidery or not, do it.  You'll love them too.worth the investmentworth the investmentworth the investment",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61y9fiYSZ-L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61H8CXbv3IL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

259,"I purchased two packs of these Sorrento Craft mixed appliques and am delighted by the quality and the assortment.

I make dresses for my Maltese dogs and like to have matching dresses for the two larger dogs and a coordinating outfit for the puppy.  These appliques were exactly what I needed.  They are iron on but since I throw their dresses in the laundry, I decided to sew around the edges for extra security.  Ironing them on first keeps them in place and the appliques are easy to sew through with a regular needle.

261,"I have had so much fun making stamps for the backgrounds of my junk journal. I don't think these would work well for detailed stamps (unless you are talented and can carve them) but they work great for what I wanted to do. Eight in the package and I have used 4 so far. I heated the foam and pressed into whatever I had that I thought would make a good background stamp. One I pressed into a piece of fluorescent lighting grid - one I pressed onto my MS Crafts Scoring Board - one I pressed onto a wire basket with a diamond mesh pattern and one I pressed onto a glass candy jar. All four made great stamps for background of collage pages (see my image added to the product page). I even had to reheat the one for the glass jar a few times to get the impression on the foam straight and it worked great every time. And, if I ever get tired of these designs I can heat the foam again and make new designs.

263,"I had plans for these cute little stamps.  I really wanted something with which I could create a background resembling old tiles.  Unfortunately, all of these stamps are so far off center (one is only 1/16"" off, but the rest are off by at least 1/8"" each), that I can't just stamp these designs into a laid-out grid.  If the design were much bigger, then 1/8"" off center wouldn't be a big deal.  I can't rely on the printed image on the top of the wood block, since that image is also off-center, but it is off going in another direction! For these, I have to actually stamp first, then center and cut out the stamped image, then line up all the cut out images.  Yes, it is a fairly simple work around, and yes, my card was still cute; therefore, I will still keep them.  However, I can't really give a product that requires a work-around any more than 2 stars.

264,"Doing some early Christmas shopping, I came across this set for my aunt. The price is what drew me after the color. Folks, you gotta understand, for a jewelry set that's $3, you're not going to get super high-quality stuff. It won't be genuine silver or real stones. Most likely, the coloring of the stones won't be exact either. Moving along... I love this jewelry set. Like I said before, the stones aren't exactly the same color as the photo on Amazon. The stones are a darker blue. I don't have any complaints about this since the set was $3. If I was to find this set somewhere in a shop, it would be $10 or more and there would be no photo to compare it to. I think the set is gorgeous. I like the darker blue honestly. You can still see through the stones. They're not so dark that you can't see the facets in the stones. The earrings are set beautifully. You really can't tell the earrings are cheap. The way the stone is set beneath the metal and crystals, it looks very much like a real silver set. The necklace, sadly, does look cheap. I believe that has to do with the gaps the crystals have around them. Again, no complaints due to price. You get what you pay for. I can see getting this set for a White Elephant party or for someone you like but don't want to spend a ton of money on. Or young girls even. I may find another set to add to this one actually.

266,"I love these kits. They come with a nice selection of bits, and a couple of plaques to work on, as well as some tracing paper, patterns, and pencils.

I've had a wood-burner for decades, and loved it. I had my nephew over for a week last summer, and showed him how to use it. He seemed to like it, so I got him one for Christmas. I liked the features of this one better than the old one I had, so I got one for me, too. The shut off switch is a very nice feature, and spares me plugging and unplugging the tool all the time, as these things do get quite hot after a while, and need to cool down often.

Walnut Hollow was the maker of my old tool, and it's lasted for at least 20 yrs, so I trusted the brand. I've used it several times since Christmas, and it's worked as expected. All the bits and instructions are perfect for someone who's never tried it before, and doesn't know where to begin. This is a great bargain, and has everything you need, right out of the box.

Wood burning is a fun, and easy pass time.  If you're giving it to a kid, then I'd get two, and be sure you're with them when they use it. If over 15, then a bit of supervision/instruction to start, and a table to work on you don't worry about too much, and they're off to the races on their own.  : )

It can be a very artistic outlet, and look around online for examples of what can be done, for inspiration. Some of it is quite amazing, and in the hand of a talented artist, real art is achieved.

For a pencil it has the same feel, and I really like it as just a sketchbook. But if you work with ink beware. The recycled paper in this book will make your markers come out looking grainy and weird. I've had this problem with other (low quality) papers in the past, but never to this extent. If you look closely at the pestilence drawing I included, you can see how the different flecks of paper are absorbing the ink differently due to the recycled paper being made up of several different kinds of paper. The other drawing included was done in my large Pentalic book, and you can see that this is not an issue on their non-recycled paper. I wish I could love this book for marker work, but as it stands it's now going to be used for warm-up sketches and doodles instead of finished work.Great book, but NOT for marker work.Great book, but NOT for marker work.Great book, but NOT for marker work.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OqZj-6mkL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717ZPrnZeDL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
271,"While I love Kona Cotton, and I will eventually use this fabric, this IS NOT white.

I use quite a bit of white Kona Cotton in my various quilting projects.  When I went to replenish my stock, the standard ""white"" was not available.  Figuring that ""bleach white"" would be about as white as you could get, I ordered 6 yards of this.

Far from white is what I got.  This is actually more of a champagne color.  Notice the difference in the shade in the picture that I am including:  Kona White on the bottom and Kona Bleach White (this order) on the top.  Quite a difference!

Again, I know I'll be able to incorporate this into quilts of various colors - just NOT ones needing WHITE.  So, if you're looking for pure white Kona Cotton, this IS NOT it.

272,"This review is for the Metallic Marker Pens, Set of 10 Colors,For Card Making,DIY Photo Album, Use On Any Surface-Paper,Glass,Plastic,Pottery,Wood (Brush Tip).

These are really excellent pens. I love brush tip markers, they are hard to find and very expensive. When I saw these metallic markers with brushes, I was excited to try them out. I love marking my stuff with my name and finding things to adhere to plastic and glass is hard. These markers came in a handy carrying case with lots of color choices!

The markers have a small lid, these are more for adults then children. Maybe children 10+ could be ok using these. Also, I read they come in hard tip as well as brush tip if you prefer a cleaner point. The markers don't have much smell, and when I opened them, they are saturated with the metallic ink and ready to use. I tried them out on regular white paper and the results were amazing. Each marker glide seamlessly across the paper and was REALLY fun to draw with. The ink is beautiful, smooth and doesnt skip or chunk up. The ink is also EXTREMELY METALLIC. There is no glitter or matte color involved in these pigments.

After checking out all the colors on a paper, I used these on my nurse stuff to write my name. I prefer to use markers as opposed to labels, so I wrote on the plastic and allowed it to dry. It does not dry instantly; I left the items to sit for a long time before I came back and checked out if they were ready to be stuck in my bag. After an hour or two, they looked perfect and the ink was smooth and shiny. I guess they could have used another layer of ink but one layer was sufficient for my purposes. At work, I wiped my clipboard I had put my name on with the markers, and unfortunately the Clorox wipes do take the ink off, so it is not completely waterproof or remove proof. That is okay though, when I purchased these, I didn't get them for this exact purpose so I will just use them on coloring books and to label stuff that isn't going to get wiped all day long. These would also make an excellent gift for an artist or someone who enjoys fine pens to draw with. 5/5 stars

277,"This 14"" Tabletop Display Easel holds up to 5 pounds of display weight. It is made of high quality 3/8"" tubular steel metal which comes with a modern gloss black powder coated finish and is lightweight. What's also great is that the feet of the easel are non-slip rubber.

What I first noticed about the easel was that is was going to be easy to set up. As soon as I took it from the box, I noticed that the holders needed to be locked and turned and from there all I did was stretch it out into a tripod; it is already put together in the tripod shape so that was easy to do.

I tried it with a framed painting, a sheet of artwork, and a canvas with artwork painted on it also. It worked well for holding all those forms of media. It also would be great for displaying data and pictures to small groups on thick (8 1/2"" x 11"", and 9"" x 12"") paper on a tabletop and/or desk.

It is easy to carry around because it is extremely lightweight (4 pounds). When it isn't being used it easily folds back up to an easy to store and/or carry size.

This came in a six-pack, which I think will be great for some people to have matching easels to display various pieces of art work!

283,"I think 4 STARs is as high as I can give an item that is adorable, but low end merchandise.

What I mean is that for 59cents this is a great deal.  You get some adorable little charms on a bracelet that is made of straight and woven vinyl strands.  It looks great, how it will hold up to wear is another thing.  My daughter will be THRILLED as she's a huge SuperNatural fan.

WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW
-- there's a wing charm that is separated by a ball.  I'm thinking the ball will be slightly different color depending on lot. My is a pinky-brassy color.
-- there's a star inside of a circle charm.  This has a metal loop on one end --like you'd find on a necklace or dangly bracelet charm-- and the other side is bound by a knot.  I think it looks cool.
-- Not sure what the other charm is but it looks like two owls to me. They too are cute.

-- the clasp is a lobster claw and the other side is a light chain.  It's the chain that allows you to adjust the length.  (It will even fit my chubby mom wrist).
-- the major flaw/weakness as I see it is the clamp ends.  I'll put up a photo shortly which I hope shows you what I'm talking about, but all of the brown strands are held in an end which is one of those things that you clamp closed so that the teeth grab the material.  If this fails it's entirely possible that we might be able to find a replacement at Michaels.  Or even Amazon.

That is the only good thing about these pins. Most of the points are too dull to pierce through two layers of fabric. Some of the pins were bent. Plus, the pins are corroded, rusted, or something.

292,"I haven't used these brushes extensively, about a dozen eleven by fourteen watercolor crayon paintings, and find them to work well. I take good care of my brushes, clean them, smooth them into shape and dry them bristles up. There has been minimal shedding until yesterday. The largest filbert (#22) started shedding on one side and I pulled out the loose bristles and it was like unraveling a sweater. A large chunk of the brush came out. I might try to clamp the metal down tighter but on the other hand, I'll probably just run it into the ground. Hope the others last longer.

294,"So far I love it!  There are some pluses and downsides.  On the plus side, because I'm prime member it came rather quickly and free shipping!  I've been cutting away since I got it last week.  The downside is the limitation on free access to Cricut Access for the Design Space. I got the machine on 3/30 and have Access until 4/17.  The feature of one year subscription apparently doesn't apply across the board.  It depends on which item you select on Amazon that day.  So read carefully.  If it's not mentioned in exactly what you purchase, it will be brief, if at all.  And it looks like it is very limited in the ""free"" images and fonts.  That being said, I love the tutorials you can find all over the internet.  I watch them over and over.  If you are afraid of icons, (and there are plenty), the tutorials will be a great saver of frustration.  I had an Expressions Cricut before.  To me there is no comparison; the Explore Air 2 beats the Expression hands down!  It is easier to use, there are more sources for help, although there are many icons, they are very organized in what each does.  So, the learning curve isn't that bad.  I'm back to scrap-booking and there isn't a page I made that hasn't come from my Cricut Explore Air 2.  In four days I've made 4 pages and 2 cards.  It is so much easier and fun with the Design Space and the images from Access.  I was anxious to get this and got a really good deal.  Be patient, the $ changes every day!  I spent my savings on supplies I've been using with my Cricut Explore Air 2 since I got it.  I have more coming in.  I agree with others, the extra money isn't worth what you get in a ""packet"".  If you price it out, and are patient, you can get some really good buys of supplies you ""intend"" to use or try out, instead of what you may or may not use in a packet.

The hooks are no better than Boye hooks which I quit using years ago.
Susan Bates Crochet Hooks are the best you can buy, the easiest to use and do a better job.
Invest in a set of Susan Bates Hooks and then get your self a couple of packages of Susan
Bates Comfort Cushions. Not much difference in price if you buy the both full sets of hooks, and
enough sets of the Comfort Cushions to cover the hooks.
You can make yourself a cover, carry all or case that will last longer than that. I bought a little

A little bottle of Frey Check, and copy of the pattern I'm currently working on if I don't have it

- The paper is perforated to meet a (1/2 inch?) spine, so you're meant to tear it at the perforations rather than the glue at the spine. The torn-out pages are 6x6 (the spine adds more width so you have to tear them out to fit in most 6x6 paper storage boxes).
- The perforations fold and tear off super easily. The paper practically pops right off. No chance of tearing.

307,"I do a great deal of painting in both 2D as well as on my sculptures and I'm always on the look out for a new set of brushes to work with, and it was the variety and value of these brushes that originally attracted me to this set. Unfortunately, upon a closer look at this set, it's apparent to me that I'm not the intended target audience of these brushes. There is therefore a rather wide discrepancy between the most appropriate users of these brushes (beginning artists) and my current skill as an artist, so please take my review simply for what it is.

There are fifteen brushes in the set, which is intended for acrylic, oil, watercolor & gouache painting. No case or brush protectors are included, but the brushes come in a sturdy plastic package, and included the following brushes:

- 11 Short Handle Brushes - #1, #2, #3, #4 & #5 Pony Round, #1, #3 & #5 Bristle Round; 1/2"" Bristle Flat, 1/4"" & 1/2"" Pony Flat
- 4 Long Handle Brushes - 2 Pony Round; 4 Pony Flat, 4 & 8 Bristle Flat

The quality is about what you might expect from beginner brushes. They have glossy black handles with indented printing that's not quite crisp, and there are no brand names painted onto them. The ends have been dipped into various colors, but it wasn't clear what those colors were intended to get across. The metal clasps were moderately tight, but I experienced some shedding as I used them. The bristles themselves came in three varieties with various qualities to them. The flat bristle felt like it was probably rigid plastic, The white ones were semi-rigid, and the brown ones were very soft. While the white ones reminded me of my regular oil painting brushes, the others reminded me of the brushes I used to use in my childhood, and when I inspected them further I could tell they were all a bit lacking in form. In my tests, the biggest issue I had was that they simply didn't deliver the crisp edges I'm accustomed to with professional brushes. Again: for beginners this may not be a huge issue, but for someone like me, they simply wouldn't perform how I wanted them to.

I had used and enjoyed other US Art Supply products before receiving this set, and even though this particular set was not up to my high standards for professional painting brushes, I still feel that beginning artists would benefit from them. Therefore, if you are looking for brushes for your kids, or if you are just starting out, I would still recommend this set of brushes, but if you are used to more exacting brushes with professional results, I would consider other options.

I am a longtime Amazon Prime customer who enjoys writing reviews in my free time. I was appreciative to be given an opportunity to test and review this brush set at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

310,"I love these brushmarkers. I've attached a color swatch to show the colors in the 60 set when applied to watercolor paper (Strathmore greeting cards also purchased on Amazon). The caps don't always match the ink and the type of paper can also create subtle differences in color, so it's helpful to do a test page like this and keep as a reference. If you're considering this set, a Pentel Aquash WaterBrush is handy to have along with a plastic lid leftover from food to lay down ink and blend. Otherwise you can also blend directly on paper. There are tutorials on YouTube demonstrating different techniques for these kinds of markers (like Jennifer McGuire). Attached is a photo of blending combinations in case it helps anyone get started.

Pros:
-water based means it gives you a watercolor effect. Different techniques can be applied.
-it works well on Handbook's square travelogue journal I got from Amazon. At first I was disappointed because the paper isn't as thick as watercolor paper. Yet with light washes from these markers, there was no bleed through, whereas alcohol markers definitely bleed through to the opposite side.
-this set provides lots of blending combinations: try, for example, lemon yellow/yellow/bright yellow.
-color names are printed on the side of the pen
-love the brush tip!! Very unique aspect of the design. I have alcohol markers and these tips are finer than the bullet tip. You can see how they make a difference especially when you flick the brush nib for a tapered effect, like in coloring hair. The zig tips are somewhat smaller than the Akashiya Sai markers. The Sais bleed more because of this, making the ink vibrant and pigment easy to apply. Depending on your needs though, the Zigs have a finer tip which sometimes mean more control over finer details. The smaller tip also means ink being conserved more easily since it's not as runny as the Sais.

Cons:
-not sure about the light fastness of the ink. I'd love any tips on how to make the finished drawing waterproof (Has anyone tried spraying fixative?) since I noticed that if water gets dripped on this ink after it dries, it will run.
-I love the color choices and if I could ask for one more thing it'd be more light colors for blending lighter shades. (Like the lightest color 00's that come with Copics)

315,"Extremely versatile material and size, easy to work with and results were acceptable with minimal pre-finishing.  Good price!

Used these sheets of plywood to make photographic props for an 18"" doll photo settings, including a little harpsicord with a fairly tight bent-wood section. (It bent very easily after a bit of thinning and a quick soak in hot water, followed by rolling between pvc pipes and taping into the desired shape for drying.  Once dry, it held the exact shape)  Used a dremel shaper to create channels to inset the right angle connects and used carpenters glue and/or hot glue. It does have a tendency to warp, so some clamping and flattening was necessary, but blue painters tape worked fine for holding things in place while the glue dried/cooled.  Once set, it becomes adequately strong and no longer warps.  For a decent paint finish, it does require putty- filling and sanding, sealing, and several light coats of paint).  I was working quickly and a bit sloppily, so the results weren't perfect for close inspection, but the prop is light weight, strong and very convincing in the photos.

I used a small table jig saw and a bench sander for cutting and shaping the parts, but the results were SO MUCH BETTER and faster than a similar prop I might have made using foamcore or bristol board!

324,"first things first, these pens are perfect for beginners!! they come with 6 different pens for a reasonable price. I tested for their brush tip, water capacity, how well it paints and how easily it is to clean.
the brush tip is awesome. it doesn't come to a complete point like other big name brush pens but it's decent and does its job. the water capacity is the same as the kuretake brush pens which is good (considering these are for travel)!! however. I have an issue with the water dripping from the pens bc it seems like it's a whole lot. and it became an issue when I was trying to paint bc a lot of water came out. and I felt like I had no control over how much water I wanted in my paintings. it also diluted my colors as I was painting which made me go back to my
color palette often. I feel as if maybe it's bc it doesn't come with a suction like a kuretake brush pen does. mudder has a hole to insert water in (like the pentel brush pens). the photos I posted is the difference of water coming out from the brush with little pressure (compared to the kuretake). also the drawing I posted; the top is my kuretake pen and the bottom is the mudder water brush pen.
overall, the pen is good and perfect for beginners who are just trying out water brush pens or water coloring in general.perfect for beginners!!!perfect for beginners!!!perfect for beginners!!!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z8o9sPlmL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71q-0-Nw+LL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61K9WfqXpdL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61t1Sz+eyrL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fka+C0pYL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
325,"I purchased the 6 color set but now I WANT ALL THE COLORS!!!!First, these are oil based rub on colors. I found that the consistency on different colors varied. Most are the consistency of an ointment, the Ruby one is a bit runnier. You can apply it with a old tee shirt or a gloved finger. You are going to need to wear rubber gloves. There is a little bit of a learning curve. Generally, a little bit goes a long way. One good thing is that it is pretty forgiving and easier to get a professional result. I took a picture of an old rusted ornamental dragonfly that took me about 15 minutes to complete. I used Spanish Copper, Patina and Ruby. I just did my composite garden fairy with Antique Gold.

328,"I don't understand how these were ever worth $40, the sale price is about spot on for how much these should ever be worth, they're pretty bad for Gel Pens.

The Red, Green, and Blue standard pen, should not be called Gel Pens, they all write like any normal pen would, really patchy don't have that fluidity of a Gel pen.
5 out of the 6 Neon are good, the green is patchy.
4 out of the 6 Pastels are horrible and patchy, White, Pink, Blue, and Green, also don't get me started on how the White Gel Pen is their 6th pastel, white isn't a pastel.
The 9 Metallic and the 11 Glitter were the best ones out of this pack, they blended together fine, though a few of them took a bit to get them started.
The packaging is horrible and flimsy, when they arrived they were falling out.
The Pens themselves feel extremely cheap like if you bought a pack of pens for $1 at the Dollar Store.
For the sale price, $8.99. they're fine, for the original price, they're out of their mind.

*Update* I was contacted by the seller saying I probably got a bad batch and offered to sent me a new pack free of charge, in fact they upgraded me to a larger pack of 100 pens because they didn't have this one in stock. Upon receiving the new pack of these pens, 4 where broken and leaking into the plastics tube, one leaked out of the tube into the container, I saw the same problems I did with the original pack. I also only had 99 pens in the 100 pack. They also do a HORRIBLE job on black. When you first use them on black, you can barely see them, as they dry they easier to see but they are so dull. I took a picture of the white compared to Sakura Gelly Roll Pen white and difference is dramatic. I stick to my original statement that these are very cheap. They really need to work on their quality control. If you really want great gel pens that aren't streaky, dull, or super watery, save up and buy from a brand that you know release a good product.Wouldn't buy them again. *Updated* Still won't buy them againWouldn't buy them again. *Updated* Still won't buy them againWouldn't buy them again. *Updated* Still won't buy them again",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d9XaZHtcL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ljX462y0L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GaFogdonL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K32hkgmsL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61be1Ftuw+L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Pyn6x0WiL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719f2sd7nWL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ATSuEd+qL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71O7VQc59fL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71porxp29nL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

332,"I make a lot of candle samples that I give away in the tea light form and the ones I was using work but wasn't the greatest. Plus I wanted to use ones that had wicks to match the product which is all natural soy. So it was better to use wicks that were lead free and worked with soy candles. So when I saw this set a friend had I knew I needed to get them as well. These make the tea light's look more professional as well as a bigger sample then the other ones I was doing.

So with the candles and tarts I sell, jicwjendennis.com I can use these due to they are more sturdy, looks more presentable and just overall really nice quality. Plus I make my own also for things I have in my house that uses tea lights so know I will have nicer ones as well as when I make up a gift basket. You just simply put the wick in the center then pour your wax then let it settle where it's solid then it will be able to be used when you light it.

If you have ever used the tin ones like me to make tea lights these are much better to use and don't bend in while making them also, it's always fun to make your own plus you can make a variety of scents to use. This way your not stuck with one scent for a while you are able to mix it up as well as hand out.

These shipped fast and arrived on time I love the price for this all the other's I had seen where a lot higher so a great price for sure, and I will be ordering more also as I need these for what I do.Great way to make your own tea lightsGreat way to make your own tea lightsGreat way to make your own tea lights",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819M3jajV0L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zMxixxyzL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SIhV5jYmL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uKI6x-+IL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lFvSwUkxL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x2e0O8axL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

The Desert Rising is a current favorite for it's soft muted colors and how nicely it stitches up. I posted a picture of some apple cozies I crocheted using it and cream as the accent color.
The yarn is nice heavier weight worsted, and works up wonderfully with a size H hook or size 8 needles for dishclothes. When you use a size F hook, you get a very dense fabric that works well for stuffed animals, cozies and double layered for functional potholders. It's reasonably priced as well. The cotton is very soft. Because it is cotton and not wool, it doesn't have any bounce back for the fibers so it doesn't work well for fitted accessories or clothing. It washes very well, but might shrink some in hot water. It won't felt, and shows stitch definition well. Great for kitchen gift items like potholders, dishcloths and cozies.

This one is designed like the others, 72 small slots and 2 large slots. At first it was hard to get them all settled so that it would roll up correctly. Once I did it a few times though, it shaped how it needs to. When you are dealing with this many pencils, the number one quality you want in these roll up cases is pencil security. If they slide around every time you open it, it would be very frustrating to use. This one holds them down beautifully. I haven't had any issues with them moving at all. Overall this is a nice case and I would recommend it.

The belt and the trim feel like leather, or maybe an imitation, I'm not sure. The trim is really soft and the strap is taught but flexible. There are two sets of snaps to hold it in place.

355,"There are 12 nylon paintbrushes in this paintbrush set, including fan-shaped, taper, and square brushes. There is a printed number for each of the sizes of paintbrushes printed on the handles.

I used a few of these long handle nylon paintbrushes to paint my face with watercolor paint (for face painting). Before I painted my face, I wet them with water and the excess water on the paintbrushes soaked up very well on a sponge. They did a great job of drawing and filling in the space of my drawings.

I also used a few of these paintbrushes for acrylic painting so I could see if they would be handy for more than just face painting. The thicker and medium size brushes did a great job of filling in paint on the spaces in my drawing that needed them. The smaller size brush did a great job of filling in small cracks and crevices, without making the paint go way out of the lines.

These paintbrushes washed clean nicely. I rinsed them in the paint water and dabbed them on a paper towel first. They looked clean at that point (although they probably were not totally clean) but I took an extra step and washed them with soap and water as well.

357,"I love these blenders. This is my fourth set. They do a lovely job on artist grade pencils of blending colors more smoothly together.

I showed a picture of the two sets that arrived. The sharpened pencils next to them are the reason I needed to order.

The picture is one I used these blender pencils on. It is from Magical Jungle by Joanna Basford. The pencils did a incredible job on all the blending and shading I do in my coloring.  I even used them on the background. Many people use other mediums for blending, but this is the one that pleases me.

The other picture is out of a book called Colouring Greece by Konstantinos Liaramantzas. It made the picture so much better to use these.

I highly recommend these for adult colorists who are serious about their artwork, or the person that colors to relax. They will enhance your work. Would buy again!

I know I did! I would have loved a kit like this when I was little!! This kit is perfect for any little princess in your life. My daughter is only 2, but she already copies everything we do. We recently got her a little play make up kit at the dollar store, and she loved it. She was putting it on mommy, daddy, and her baby dolls. It was an extremely cheap kit however (I mean what do you expect from the dollar store right?), and everything was like vasoline with a little bit of a tint to it that didn't even show up. I am so impressed with this kit from Go Green Face Paint. First of all it is organic! I love this!! I can feel good about letting my daughter play with this knowing she isn't smearing chemical laden make up on her face. It is hypoallergenic so it can be used on any skin type including sensitive skin. It comes with 4 eye shadows, 4 blushes, 4 lipsticks, 1 lip gloss, an eye shadow brush, a lip brush, a blush brush, and a very cute make up bag to put it all in. There is a nice variety of colors, and they are all very bright and vibrant. They are very pigmented and show up well on the skin. Any little girl will feel like they are just like mommy, with their own real make up. This honestly doesn't even seem like a pretend play set. This would be great for any little girl's party or sleep over, or just to play around with at home. I love it, and would definitely recommend it to others! *I received this make up kit at a discounted price for testing purposes, and for an honest review. The opinions in this review are 100% my own based on my experience with the product, and I made no commitment to leave a positive review.*Perfect play make up kit for my little princess!Perfect play make up kit for my little princess!Perfect play make up kit for my little princess!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DUJOL7zdL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

361,"I decided to upgrade my Brother Project Runway machine and order this Juki to have a more heavy duty industrial type machine.  I did a thorough search including you tube videos and decided on this model.  I make home decor items like pillow and purses with upholstery fabrics as well as other home sewing projects.  I was looking for a machine that would sew well over heavy fabrics like jeans and layers of upholstery.  I love the super fast albeit straight stitch of this machine.  It's super simple to operate as it has no bells and whistles....just an awesome and fast straight stitch.  The needle threaded takes some getting used to to get it to work, but once you do, its pretty good, but not necessary.  There's a you tube video to help with that too.  I broke the thread cutter on the first one I purchased and Juki replaced it very easily after I called and spoke with the nicest guy in tech support (I held the phone up to the machine so he could hear the noise it made).  I broke the bobbin case on the second Juki, but again the vendor's tech support is super nice, patient, and sent me a new one, no problem.  I love this machine!!  It will glide over many layers of heavy fabric so easily.  I probably need a walking foot machine for some of my super thick fabric layered projects, but otherwise this machine is great.  Wish it had a zig zag foot, but I just use the old machine for this.  Most of the parts are metal and will hold up well as opposed to a cheaper machine that is mostly plastic.  I love the fast and slow options for stitching.  You will still want various needles like jeans needles for heavier fabrics.  This seller has been great to work with me when I had to return the first one and the price was very reasonable for the machine purchase.If butter were a sewing machine, it would be a JUKI!!!!If butter were a sewing machine, it would be a JUKI!!!!If butter were a sewing machine, it would be a JUKI!!!!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K474nQRaL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sLaX7cdjL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

The variety of brushes is awesome and I have only used a few, but they are great quality. I followed the directions about getting them ready for use on the back of the packaging and have not seen any bristles in my ""art"" pieces.  My daughters love that we have a variety of brushes so we can try different techniques and I do think I am getting a little better at the designs, but I'll keep my day job for now!

The plastic is high quality: It's thick and clear without fogging. I particularly appreciate it's small footprint... It takes up minimal physical and visual space. I also like the concept of vertical organization as not documents are designed to be viewed from the portrait orientation rather than landscape. I bought some vertical file folders by Martha Stewart to accompany this organizer. Unfortunately, they're just slightly too wide (they can be jammed in but do not fit comfortably). I have been eyeing some vertical files available on Amazon by Smead so hopefully those will work better.

371,"While these pencil cases are definitely cute, they're also not perfect. I agree with other reviewers that these have a handmade look to them, especially since the stitching on the cat faces is incorrect. Theres a thin black thread connecting the different parts of the face that should be on the back of the piece where it won't show. The bags themselves are well-stitched together, and each have the same sky-blue liner inside. The zippers all work fine, but the liner does bunch a bit by the zipper when the bags are empty and could potentially catch on the zipper. Pens or other items weighs the liner down and keeps it from bunching.

I was able to comfortably fit fifteen fine point sharpies in one bag, and while full-sized pencils do fit, its a bit tight. These work better as a pen case, or for makeup or other small items. They work well as little carrying bags, and for under $5 for the set of four I think they're a decent buy. Just know that the craftsmanship of the decoration isn't the best.

373,"I have been looking for a tool for a while so that we can create wood burnings as a art project in our homeschool. I wanted to give this one a try and below are the pros and cons of this product:
Pro:
It heats up pretty fast. Burns the wood perfectly. The different tips give you different looks. There is also a attachment in tis kit that you can put a cutting blade. The size is perfect for kids or adults. The cord is very long and not like the ones we played with as a kid. For short projects this is a great tool.
Cons:
The color in the handle being orange that as my husband stated working with plastic injection molding that it is not a high temp plastic. It would be black if it was. That over time there could be issues with the handle. My daughter told me the handle was getting warm in just the short time of using. Most professional ones have a pad on the holding part of the handle to keep your hand safe. Also we used the tiny point one and as it heated up that the tip even with light pressing began to bend. It was not a tempered metal otherwise it would not do that. The thicker tips didn't bend.

Overall with the pros and cons this is a nice little kit for someone that has small projects or for school projects. As far as long term use I will have to use more to be able to tell you and update. This was fun as I never got one as a kid and to spend time creating with my daughters was fun. Compaired to others on Amazon it is right up there with most listed.

Plain and simple, and contrary to the listing here, they DID NOT WORK in my Brother LB6800THRD (which is the same machine as the Brother SE400).  They say they are SA156, but obviously they do not meet all of the specs of the SA156 or else they would fit.  None of them would fit all the way down on the spindle and they all had a taper to their hole meaning they would only go on in one direction.  I don't know if my package was mislabeled or if these are their standard SA156, but clearly and as you can see in the video, they simply did not even fit my spindle.  Very, very frustrating after having waited to receive them only to find out they are no good.

These, like so many others here on Amazon, appear to by manufactured by a company called Bobbins.  For me, that means trying another package from another seller who also lists Bobbins as the manufacturer will probably also not work.  I have returned mine to Amazon for a refund and to make a point with the seller that their product does not work.

Keep an eye out at the popular fabric store that starts with a J (don't know if we can name other stores here, sorry), as they put the Style 15 (which these were supposed to be) on sale for half price.  Made by Dritz, they have the 12 pack for $1.99.  Not only should they fit, they are just pennies more than these and you get a name brand that you can immediately pick up or return should you have any problems.  For that, I'll gladly pay the $0.02 more per bobbin, and I bet you would, too.  Plus you can stack your 25% OFF mobile coupons and make them even cheaper than these.

Lucky you if they fit your machine, but as for me, I'm stacking up on bobbins from the J store when they are on half price sale (like right now) and stacking with an additional 25% off coupon, too.

Next, one was broken inside the packaging but the broken off piece was no where to be found.  That means that it was broken before being packaged.  Every one of them was smooth inside with no molding tip residue.  This plastic was more firm and flexed less than an original Brother bobbin that I had.  The Brother was softer and bent easier.  This one feels brittle by comparison.

These arrived in a bubble wrap envelope inside another envelope.  Be careful when you open the inside envelope, as the bobbins are loose inside of it.  I was not expecting that and ended up catching the bobbins as a few when flying.

As with all these newer plastic bobbins, be doubly sure to wind them very slowly and with a light tension.  Failure to do so will most likely result in a bobbin that is stuck on your bobbin winder.  The only way to remove it at that point is to literally unwind enough of the thread until you can remove it.  Very frustrating if you don't know that and you are using expensive thread or the last of your matching color.  Plus the first time you experience that, it's an Oh Feces moment.

Metal bobbins never had that problem and could withstand the tension and speed.  But today's machines use the clear plastic both because some machines have magnets in the bobbin section that a metal bobbin would interfere with and other machines have light sensors to detect end of bobbin condition.  Please do not use metal bobbins if your machine came with the plastic ones, as you can ruin your machine.  You can generally use plastic in an older machine that takes metal bobbins, but not the other way around.  Not worth the expense and risk to test it out.

 Pros:
Inexpensive by comparison to brand name ones.  Nice and smooth on the bar of the bobbin with no visible spurs on it.

 Cons:
Clearly they are not manufactured to SA156 specs as they did not fit.  No QC for broken pieces.  Waste of money and time.  Seems to be a hit and miss as to whether or not it works for you on your machine.  Because of the poor QC all around, I really cannot see giving these more than a 1 star.

 Suggestions for Improvement:
Check your manufacturing specs as these clearly do not match SA156 style bobbins.  QC your pieces before packaging so that the customer does not receive broken ones.  Let US be the ones to break them!

 Would I buy again?
No.

390,"I was very pleased with vibrant colors of these threads.  I also liked the weight of the thread and its strength.

However the spool design is not thought through.  The thread ends have no place to be secured when you are not sewing, so until I came up with a solution I wasted a lot of the thread to tangles.  I also had trouble with it on my Bernina - the thread was catching on the uneven edges of the core.

I came up with solutions to both problems. Both of my solutions are described at the end of this review. However, I give this thread 3 stars because because I had to come up with how to compensate for the bad spool design to make the thread usable.

Solution #1:
To keep the thread from unwinding and tangling, I use a small piece of opaque scotch tape (with one end taped to itself as a tab so it is easy to pull on).  The opaque tape is easy to remove and gets better with more use as it becomes less and less tacky.  Still good enough to keep the thread taped to itself, but easier and easier to remove.
I am attaching a photo for reference.

Solution #2:
Instead of using the thread directly on the sewing machine, I use it on stand alone thread holder. It pulls the thread up clear of the uneven edges, so nothing gets caught on the bad spool.  This is the thread holder I use:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dritz-R-Cone-Thread-Holder/dp/B0019KDYL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dritz(R) Cone Thread Holder</a> kludge solutions within kludge solutions within kludge solutions within",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ebCWYtdnL._SY88.jpg,positive,anger

I have found that Die-Namics dies work with all major die-cutting tools on the market.

I have used at least one of my Die-Namics dies well over a hundred times and it still cuts sharply.

Having said that Die-Namics dies work on A2 cards, I need to point out that the 'Congratulations' die is too large to fit on an A2 card.  Furthermore, it doesn't cut completely.

400,"These water brushes are okay, but not what I was hoping for.

Pros:
-Great variety of sizes for both shape
-Nice water flow

Cons:
-The largest round brush won't keep a point.
-The large round also has some kinked or otherwise defective bristles.
-The large flat brush leaks every time I tighten the top. Even if the barrel is only half full. I think it's coming from the brush somehow.
-The caps do not stay on the backs of the barrels while in use.
-The caps on the two largest flat brushes don't stop well and you can easily crush the brushes by putting them on a little too far. (The flat brushes in the round caps is also awkward, but I don't know what else you could really do).

Overall I don't necessarily regret buying them, and based on other reviews I may have just gotten a bad set, but I would probably try a different set if I needed to replace them in the future.

EDIT: I've only used the largest brush maybe half a dozen times, and this last time I filled it and tightened the cap the whole thing snapped in half. Like, it wasn't even fully tightened.

411,"I have been looking for a way to easily make water-proof labels for bottles that go in the shower for a while now.  This is a relatively inexpensive solution without having to purchase the heavy-duty Xyron machines that cost way too much for home hobbies.

Pros:
Waterproof - so far, these are working out in the shower.  I am not dunking the labels into a tub full of water, but they are getting quite wet.
Thickness - the lamination is really thick and makes the label nice & stiff, which is much easier to work with, especially if your label is pretty big - they don't scunch up and wrinkle and stick on themselves and make a mess.
Strong Adhesive
Easy to push out any air bubbles

Cons:
Thickness - if you are making a small item & it needs to curve around something with texture or something with a curve, the adhesive tends to want to jump back up, so that the laminated item is flat again.
Cloudiness - the laminated result is NOT clear.  It is pretty cloudy.  I had printed labels out on clear film & used this Xyron product to try to waterproof the labels and stick them on pump bottles.  I don't know if it is the adhesive on the back, but there is definitely a noticeable light gray film on it.  That cloud was enhanced by the fact that I used clear film on a clear bottle.  If you are using items with a color, you wouldn't see the film on the parts of that there is paper; however, you'd still be able to see it on the edges, since you really need to leave at least an eighth of an inch margin from your paper to the edge of the lamination.  I've included pictures so that you can see what I mean by the film.  The first picture shows how clear the film is before I applied the Xyron.  The second picture shows the cloudy film that is visible.

Cleaning, oiling and putting away when not in use is your best
bet for reducing (or eliminating) service calls.
This machine is easy to clean, easy to oil and a joy to sew with.
The threader works great; be patient, follow through the instructions.

I came across this Masterson Rinse Well and I had to try it out. Oh, my gracious! This little gem really does do what it claims. This is a wonderful invention. It's great being able to have fresh water quickly rather than keep having to go and empty and refill a container. Leaves more time for the enjoyment of painting. I would highly recommend it. The fresh water goes in the tank and gravity feeds fresh water into the small well.

424,"I was working on a rush order for a customer, it was a free standing lace mini hat & I had run out of my wash away stabilizer.  I normally use the Vilene Water Soluble Embroidery Stabilizer, but it was not eligible for prime shipping & it would not arrive in time for me to complete the order. Because of this I decided to go with this. I honestly couldn't be more pleased. In comparison to the Vilene this actually seems to be a little bit more substantial (a touch thicker). For me this was a huge bonus. My embroidery hoops are old & have seen better days. So the slightly thicker weave of this stabilizer made it a bit more stable in the hoop.  This is not like the clear topper wash away stabilizer. This is a fibrous stabilizer is more like a fabric than a plastic. This makes it the perfect thing for making Free Standing Lace. I will note that that it takes slightly longer to dissolve if you're using cold water. I did find, however that warm water works fantastically.

Some tips for using this with free standing lace.
If you're having issues with your pattern stitching out properly (leaving gaps & not lining up correctly) this could be a couple things. First, you may have pulled your stabilizer to tight. It is very tempting while hooping for your free standing lace to tighten the stabilizer in the hoop.. try to avoid this. If you pull the stabilizer to tight, you stretch the fibers in awkward directions & this could cause the stabilizer to provide an inconsistent pattern. The other thing might be that the hoop is just not holding the stabilizer tightly enough in the hoop causing it to pull loose from the hoop while embroidering the pattern out. This happens to me because my hoops are to worn to tighten enough. I resolved this by using a second layer of stabilizer.. I also use a layer of the clear Wash-Away - Water Soluble Embroidery Stabilizer & Topping
If your just starting out with free standing lace.. It can be tricky, so don't give up & keep trying. It just takes a while to get the knack of it. If you just starting out & having issues, feel free to ask me. You never know, I may have some tips to help you on your way
RINSING - I found that using the sink sprayer with warm water seems to be the easiest way to dissolve the stabilizer. The sprayer helps immensely in clearing out the negative spaces without damaging the look of the freestanding lace by trying to dissolve it quicker with your fingers.

If you're looking to do free standing lace this is a must have. I would recommend it to anyone needing a good quality fibrous wash away stabilizer

435,"I am sharing one of the pictures I colored with these pencils.  I am not the best colorer in the world, but I color every single day and have three brands of color pencils, and several brands of gel pens.

I have one brand I used once because the lead was too hard and a professional brand that I love, but I can see all of the strokes and swirl marks in large areas.

I found that I liked this set a lot.  The color is pretty smooth and in this particular book it looks sort of glossy.  The colors are bright and can be laid down lightly or with a bit of pressure to make the colors darker.  I found that I can put multiple layers of color in the same area either to fill in white spots, darken, on shade.

I included the picture from the order page to point something out.  You may not notice, but the colors (such as the browns) look almost the same color.  They look that way in real life too.  However, check out my color chart.  They are definitely very different shades.  The lead might look dark brown, but it is actually a tan like the color on the top of the pencil.  So don't let the color of the lead fool you.  There are 48 unique colors.

I tend to scrape tiny amounts with a knife and spread them on the paper, this gives me almost next to nothing dust/mess. I've also tried just rubbing them with cotton balls and blending them on paper and that works well too. I've included one of my coloring pages to show how the pastels look, I'm still learning how to use them effectively!

My only complaint is that some of the sticks arrived broken and some of the lighter colors were smudged from the darker sticks. It's not really a problem since you can still use the pieces anyway.

450,"I really wanted to gild finely-detailed stamps.  After some research, the verdict seemed to be that the Flitter Glue is really the only solution that was designed for detailed images.  I got the set, since, at the time of my purchase, the set was only $1 more than the glue by itself.  When I opened the box, I immediately noticed that the foam stamp pad is exactly the same material as the Ranger Cut-N-Dry Foam Stamp Pad (which was really cheap when Amazon had it as an ""add-on"" item), and the plastic putty knife was the same as many that I already had (the ones crafters use for texture paste, gesso, etc.).  OK, so I paid an extra $1 for the little gray sponge and the tray.  No biggie.  I proceeded to test the claim that Flitter Glue is the only product that provides detailed images.  I read the instructions in the box carefully and re-watched some YouTube videos on the process.  I then used the products to attempt to guild a fossil leaf image.  I also made a mess with the foil flakes (which I expected), but the result was no better than using a regular-sized embossing powder.  I can get better results using a fine embossing powder!  I was really disappointed.  I tried several more times & got pretty much the same result.  Plus, I was really annoyed with the mess the glue made on the stamps & having to clean the stamps between applications (I used StazOn Stamp Cleaner).  Previous to getting the Flitter Glue, I had tried Ranger Sticky Embossing Powder on VersaMark ink, and, with that method, I could at least avoid having to clean my stamps.  I would say the resulting images were about the same between the Sticky Embossing Powder and the Flitter Glue.  However, since my issue with both products was with the lack of detail, I thought I thought I'd try VersaFine instead of the usual VersaMark with the Sticky Embossing Powder.  I figured that the VersaFine usually provided a really detailed & crisp image and the ink would just be covered by the metallic flakes, but I was still doubtful, since the Sticky Embossing Powder is not very fine (more a High than a Fine embossing powder).  I was shocked at how well that method worked and how much detail I was able to get.  I am including a picture of the best result I was able to get with the Flitter Glue (the leaf on the right) next to the final result using Sticky Embossing Powder on VersaFine ink (the leaf on the left - sorry, I'd already mounted it onto a card by the time I thought to do a review).  Given how much better the Sticky Embossing Powder worked and how much of a mess the Flitter Glue makes on my stamps (plus, I hold my breath each time I use it on a stamp, cuz I am afraid that I won't be able to clean off the stamp completely), I think the flitter glue will end up as trash.  Even the box is useless, since it is much easier to get the left-over metal flakes from a coffee filter back into the container than from the box to the container!Much Easier and Cleaner to Use Sticky Embossing Powder!Much Easier and Cleaner to Use Sticky Embossing Powder!Much Easier and Cleaner to Use Sticky Embossing Powder!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q+Qbg+-YL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

457,"Being able to get a panel set like this for this price, well its not anything I can find in stores. I covered earlier on the great products you get from U.S Art Supply and I am always floored by the quality and price points. U.S Art Supply makes crafting and creating art affordable and that tends to stimulate creativity because there is nothing to stop you. I get ideas just like everyone and the worse part is wanting to do but not being able to afford to so.

The U.S Art Panel Assortment Includes:

Six 5x7 panels
Six 8x10 panels
Six 9x12 panels
Six 11x14 panels

Retail Price Point- $34.96 for a total of 24 panels in 4 different sizes. Ships free with Amazon Prime membership too.  The panels have a weight of almost 10 pounds, so there is no skimping on materials and quality here!  Each panel has on the back a label that the artist can complete reflecting the title of the piece, artist name, medium used and date with signature.  How neat is that!

Verdict:

This is a great starter kit because you have panels in all sizes and if a wonderful kit for an established artist. Great for crafting and even for a family activity. Everyone can create anything for any wall size and what I like about panels versus canvases that have the wooden frame, they are super easy to frame because of being flat. The panels are made with acid free materials and are more of a hardboard versus the give a stretched out canvas may have. You can draw, sketch and paint with any media from oils, acrylics to pastels. No limitations! The edges of the panels are wrapped over neatly, so no raw-edge to have to cover or worry about. The acid free mention is worth noting because it means your creation from art-work and/or memories will not deteriorate or age due to the panels materials. These panels are also great for more than painting with the plethora of metal crafting materials available from metal flowers to even magnified glasses. You can create a real masterpiece without even having to wait because this panel assortment from U.S. Art supply ships free from Amazon with Prime membership.

468,"Making the soap:
-I love that this already has all the soap ""parts"" to it, so you don't have to mess with lye. All you have to do is chop up your desired amount of honey base into small chunks, melt it into the microwave (I would do it for 15-30 seconds, stir, then 15-30 seconds again while mixing in between to make sure nothing gets burnt), and the pour into your mold! I do wish it came with some instructions, just because I had to look at the reviews to figure out what I was supposed to do since I'm new to this! The color came out as I expected a honest base to, clear with a yellowish tint. I used some essential oils in my mix (about 20 drops for one pound). At first, this made the smell overwhelming, but when I set it outside to cool (for around 4 hours or so), it had gone down quite a bit and was just a nice pleasant smell. It likely will change depending on the scent you are using, so just play it by ear.

Using the soap:
-once the soaps were done, I decided to put one by my sink to wash my hands and one in my shower. When I was washing my hands, I noticed it lathered really nicely and let my hands feeling clean and soft. The oils I used did not transfer onto my hands. Instead, my hands just smelled like typical ""washed hands with soap"" generic smell, which didn't bother me. When I used it in the shower, it again lathered well, but I did not get the same ""clean"" feeling (ended up using my regular body wash as well). Not sure why (could be in my head), but that is my experience. Consequently, I will be using this for hand soaps and not body soaps in the future. Still very pleased overall.Great Beginner's Soap Base!Great Beginner's Soap Base!Great Beginner's Soap Base!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iz17n+J3L._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

476,"I bought Snazaroo Face Paint (2 in light grey, 1 in white and 1 in black) and no matter what I did, the makeup would cake and crumble before I could get even coverage. I used very little water as recommended (I also tried more and less in other attempts hoping to fix the issue) and nothing helped. I tried applying with high quality smooth makeup sponges, my fingers and a foundation brush as well, hoping one of those might help but nothing did. I was left with makeup that kept wanting to get crumbly and flake off, and even after setting it, trying to apply shading lightly with a powder was a nightmare. I see so many good reviews for this, which is why I tried it over all others, but honestly, it really let me down and I am frustrated that I chose to use Snazaroo. All I wanted was a body paint with good coverage, non shiny finish, and no caking/crumbling/flaking/cracking. I give it two stars, as by the 5th try I had an ok looking application, but not even an hour later it was getting crumbly still. It did come off pretty easy and didn't irritate my skin, so another plus there. I didn't apply it with a heavy hand, and used the recommended smooth upward strokes. Overall though I am disappointed.

478,"This review is for the Wise Bird Easter Holiday Party Red Pattern, Decorative Washi Tape Sticky Paper Masking Adhesive DIY Tape, Office Class School Birthday Diary Scrapbook Craft Gifts Tape, 32ft/roll, Set of 6.

This washi tape originally caught my eye because of the graph heart design. It reminded me of a Nurses EKG paper and I collect washi tape and am always looking for cute designs! I decided to order this collection and I am glad I did because it is definitely VERY cute!

The package comes with six designs all very different but great for crafting. This set is mainly reds and greens, but not holiday style, more like everyday style. The pack of six is wrapped in one large package so if you are gifting this  it is already wrapped good. Or you could break up the pack of six and gift each separate.

The tape is fairly thick and once you lay it down on the paper  you cant see through it. It looks bright, vivid and colorful. The tape comes off each roll very easily, and then you can cut when you reach the desired amount you want to take off. Most important, this does not rip so you won't be using it and have it rip on you. It also lies very flat and doesnt bubble up or peel at the corners. When you are finished using it, there is a nice professional look to its application in crafting and decorating.

I love these designs and the company has many other cute designs that are worth checking out. Overall, I would give this 5/5 stars for its manufacturing, quality and design. Great tape!

485,"I needed some 100% cotton thread for some projects. We have no area fabric stores and the Walmart only offers Coats and Clark, which I do not care for. So, I came to Amazon for a choice.

I ordered Connecting Threads in the black/white/grays set. I've only used the black and the white so far. The black was fine, but the WHITE spool, the one I needed the most, has been a mess!

So far, the white thread has broken multiple times. One time, it looked like a place where two lots of thread were connected, but it broke where connected.  It snapped off at the needle several times as well. So, I put a brand new needle on and rethreaded the machine.

Then it started making these little ""coils"" above the needle eye and of course, breaking. It also created some stitching problems that were unique to this white spool only.

I apparently got a bad/lemon spool with my white one. Darned shame, because the black stitched just fine.
Taking off one star for the bad spool and one star for the frustration and time lost fiddling with this breaking, faulty thread.One spool is a MESS. The others seem okay so far.One spool is a MESS.

I create handmade, pressed fabric flowers with this product for my business and have gone through many bottles of the stuff. I love that it has very little odor (something I know my customers wouldn't hesitate to tell me about) and it prevents the fabric from fraying somewhat when it's cut. I saturate my fabric before leaving it to dry completely for a few hours, however, you can also dilute the product with water for less stiffness. It's also very easy to clean up and if you need to, you can also wash it out of your project completely and then start again. I believe the packaging has changed somewhat recently from peach to blue and white which is different than shown but it bears no affect.

Imo there are better products to use for texture but if you can get this for cheap at Joanns like I did w a coupon than it will be worth your $$.  It doesn't have the luminosity that the mediums the studio quality lines bring.  Dries to a white opaque matte finish.

The quality is truly exceptional. The brush tips are very precise, the water based ink is very rich and vibrant. The color selection is perfect and exactly as shown in the product description.
I use these in a variety of applications, mostly with stamping. The end results are beautiful! I highly recommend this wonderful set to anyone who is considering to purchase it. Also, the end caps are removable... So, one could refill these pens if needed. So far, I haven't experienced a pen gone dry. They have held up very well, ink wise, and that's with moderate use.

I ran my fingers through it several times without wetting it and I didn't loose a single bristle! It is a very large brush. I only used it to apply wax over Annie Sloan paint. It distributed wax evenly with ease. I've heard you use less wax with a brush. I started my project before a received the brush so in the beginning I was applying the wax with an old t-shirt. I'm so glad I stopped and waited for the brush! I've refinished a dresser and a king platform bed base with drawers and still have about 1/2 a can of clear wax. Like I said I'm new to chalk painting so I'm not sure how much wax is normally used on these projects. I'm going to use the brush to paint on my next project and I will update you all on how well the brush holds and applies Annie Sloan paint.

495,"Such a cute project, and finally something new to do. So many home art kits for kids are the same old ideas, just repackaged. This one is totally different than any other I've see. I learned about Yarn Bombing a few years ago when it first started to make the news. I loved the look of it, especially on trees. So when I saw this craft kit for a little yarn bombed tree, I thought it would be such a cute project for my daughter.

The kit and the project is every bit as fun as it looks. The tree is a nice large size so you really can hang long necklaces from it. And while at first you think the project might be over too quickly, as you get into it you realize it will take some time. My daughter worked on it for a few hours.

There's tons of yarn included. They didn't skimp on that at all. And the yarn is already cut and sectioned off for you so you don't need to divide up the colors or cut the pieces into the correct lengths. Everything in the kit is ready for you to start working on your project, without any need of prep work before hand.

And the end result is so pretty and unique to the person who made it. You can design it with any number of combinations of colors or patterns. Twist the yarn, spin the yarn, double up or triple up colors, etc. Make a section all one color, a few colors or a rainbow of colors, and make every section different from the others.

From using these while trying to learn from videos, I have noticed that this set of pastels has paper around each color unlike others I seen in other peoples' boxes. I took the paper off each one I used so that I could do a side sweeping motion and noticed when I switch back into holding it like a pencil, you will get it on your hands. That's fine pastels are messy,

They blend easy with your finger however there is a limit for blending, too much you will need to try and take off with your blending stump. I suspect you won't need to do this if you apply a fixative and plan for that attentional color.

My pastels arrived quickly and double plastic covered, so none of mine fell out or touched each other.

513,"I rarely write a bad review, I really dislike a product I always stop first and ask myself is it just me and my expectations about something I receive yet it is everything that was described so I recieved what was being sold? In a case like that, I thinks it's person and not the product this however is totally different and it's not me but %100 of the pencil. I looked at these for over month almost daily and was on the fence until I saw a pretty good price drop and thought what the heck, I love round pencils and these looked like a very bright color palate.  The box just arrive, sorry I should of taken a picture of the pencils were all popped out of their tray beds, but not a big problem at all really, they just had a rough journey apparently on their way here. The pencils weren't in color order, there way a total lack of color comb when placed in the box willynilly, I was aware from a previous question asked that they did not have a color name or number on each pencils and that was OK I could make my own for good pencils right. However, per the manufacture about a month ago, they said per all the feedback they recieved they are going to add the color name to each pencil on the next run, so now your looking at August if they follow through. Right now I don't care about the name, right now I'm upset and I care that I did not recieve the pencils promised as shown by all the images on this listing. I know buyer beware and for $17 can you really expect great quality pencils? Of course not, but with the major selling point of these a soft core and reading all the reviews, disregarding the ones that recieved free pencils to leave a great one, most reviews were better than expected, I was a bit surprised and intrigued so I finally broke down and bought a set. I love round pencils maybe it's because all my high end sets are round band they do feel better in my hand, I also like the fact the barrel on these were white with the color on the tip as shown in all the images. Sadly, I found these pencils were not any of these things and not at all the pencils shown, I did recieve the tin box shown and that was it. I'm sure most of you have seen those cheap pre school type pencils, not junior or high school not even elementary but these are preschool quality pencils and that's being generous. They are the driest of dry, the hardest of hard, the the blandest of bland, I could go but you get the idea. I would stay clear of these and not waste your time. I did uploaded pictures to show you the wrong pencils I recieved, purchased from Scoyo, btw which is no longer listed as a seller, and again trust me these are the opposite of soft but harder than hard and since one of the selling points is a soft core I'm assuming hard is not what your looking for but if hard, bland, dull light colors are, then these are the pencils for you.

Today we made a frame for a picture of her cat by hot-gluing them around a standard, 4 x 6 flat painted frame and it turned out nicely. She had fun separating and counting all the different cats and then deciding where to place them on the frame. She's 11 so she was able to use the glue gun to stick them on with my supervision.

The buttons are pretty sturdy but I wouldn't' want to put them on anything that went through the wash, at least not often. They may withstand hand washing okay, but I'd be hesitant to machine wash them for fear that they'd break or lose color.

It features the following colors:  Titanium White, Lemon Yellow, Yellow Ochre, Vermilion, Crimson Red, Viridian, Hooker's Green, Cobalt Blue, Ultramarine Blue, Burnt Sienna, Raw Umber and Lamp Black.  This covers your primary colors, red, yellow, and blue and then some allowing you to mix many custom colors.  I noticed immediately that the tubes are very high quality and each one comes sealed with a puncturing lid to open (rather like a medicine tube).  When you are finished painting, the cap seals just as easily and keeps the paint hydrated and ready to use.  The colors themselves are vibrant and consistent.  Like most acrylic paint, they dry relatively quickly ( I would say within 15 minutes or so) and can be thinned and cleaned up easily with water. These tubes are on the smaller side, but definitely good to get you started.  I found that the paint's quality and thick consistency makes them last (a little paint goes a long way).

When I found out how easy it was I was excited to make my first garland. I had a paper pad with Christmas designs and I punched out every different design there was. The pennants are easy to put together and they actually stay together. I ended up making a pretty long garland and the only time a pennant came apart is when it got tangled.

I put the garland up on the wall behind a lighted ""tree"" (plant) and there was enough to go around the corner too (see photos).

The paints are very clean and highly pigmented color. Artist grade.

The metal, enameled palette with the flask is very convenient for impromptu painting while out and about.

The flask and water brush container which holds water and sits on the side of the palette makes this extra-convenient.

Accompany this with a travel watercolor brush, and paper, and you have a perfect little paint studio on the go.

The palette is made with a strong weight of metal, which will last many, many years, properly cared for.

It has white enameled interior which makes for a perfect mixing surface.

It fits so compactly in the hand, and yet holds up to 12 half-pans of paint.

The water in the flask gives two fills in the brush cleaning container that sits on the side of the palette.

This set comes with eight half-pans. But you can add four more. I have empty half pans that I will fill from my tube paints.

I have other travel palettes, but this particular design is my very favorite. It is a little treasure.

Worth every penny of the purchase price.

Get yourself a good quality travel brush and good quality watercolor paper to pair with this good quality palette.

If you have this palette with a travel brush from DaVinci brushes, also made in Germany, you have a fabulous little pocket studio of excellent quality.

You won't find a better quality pocket setup.

Treat yourself to this little travel palette if you like quality and well-made art tools.

I like to keep one in my vest pocket with travel brush and little watercolor ATC blank cards, and a pencil, a fountain pen, and a kneaded erasure.

Perfect little studio on the go. Be prepared for that moment of inspiration. I also like to give impromptu gifts of little watercolor paintings to use as bookmarks.

I have various palettes which I have different colors in for different possibilities.

This one I thought I'd just have eight pans for starters.
I have filled 7 of my own half-pans with other Schmincke and Daniel Smith paints.

One great thing about these types of palettes is that you can change pans of color whenever you like.

I like to have different moods of color available to just pack and go with, so I have numerous palettes.

But one suffices because the half-pans come out and go back in easily.

If you want one treasure watercolor travel palette, this is a little treasure.

I like painting little ATC cards on the go, and especially love putting a smile on a person's face when they see me painting and I give it to them as a little surprise present.

One other treasure I have is a vest with many pockets.

I can keep many supplies in the vest, pens, pencils, little papers, and a travel palette or two.

I use a cigar box in the car and paint when I am a passenger on a long drive.

So many possibilities for fun! :)))

While the price is in the low $70.00, it's a good deal.
Unless you have a real fine art supply store nearby, you likely will not see these in the art stores.

But even if you do find them in a store, you will pay much more.

Take advantage of the low prices while you can.

529,"This is not my favorite paper at all.  It is very thin and extremely toothy, partially my fault because I didn't check the thickness before ordering.  But I don't think that anyone would want paper that is this thin for their art.  I don't see the paper holding up well over time, and it is hard to get much detail with the laid finish, once again my fault for not paying attention. Also it doesn't have the prefer rated dot thingies that you can tear it out by. The paper is directly attached to the ring binding and has to be cut out. Since I can't seem to cut a straight line, that's a big downer for me.  I will only use this paper for scrap pieces.  I've included pictures to show how thin in paper is, and a quick sketch with a charcoal pencil to show the laid finish of the paper.  Overall I do not recommend this product.

If you are a charcoal artist I would highly recommend the Strathmore Bristol Vellum 100lb.  Not this product. The Vellum 100lb. is thick and has a great smooth surface.  I have even used it for portraits and I loved how they came out.

535,"Really like this little set! I recently bought this other set https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Cotman-Colour-Compact/dp/B00004THXH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472576228&sr=8-1&keywords=cotman+compact+watercolor+set to try out watercolor painting and I really like it but it was still a little larger than I wanted for taking with me.  The other pocket set https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Cotman-Colour-Compact/dp/B00004THXI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472576228&sr=8-1&keywords=cotman%2Bcompact%2Bwatercolor%2Bset is a bit cheaper which is great but the brush is TINY.  Nothing but detail work is possible.  The best thing about these sets is that the pans are all removable so I can swap around what I want in each set.  The basics are repeated but after buying the compact set I felt I wanted a few other colors, even though I can mix.  Mostly I wanted the black, violet and gray.  I think these are great paints for someone just starting out who wants something better quality but still affordable. They mix nicely and a little goes a LONG way.

But I mostly love this set because of the water brush! I wasn't sure about it at first, considering how simple it looks, but it goes together easily AND securely, the pieces are tight enough when fitted together that it doesn't leak around the join, even with pressure.  Now the tip stays nice and pointy and seems to be continuously wet, but does not leak a bunch of water out.  That is until you squeeze it, then it does let out large beads above the tip if you push too hard.  I found that very gentle pressure wets the brush without the big drop of water coming out and possibly ruining your work.  This is my first water brush and I REALLY like it.  The tip on this is still fairly small, but I mostly like working on smaller pieces anyway.  You can also fit the brush in the pan when it's filled with water, and the area holding the brush is smartly thought out.  It has inserts that keep the brush from sliding around, so the brush won't slide left or right, risking the tip being smushed against the side.  I discovered also that the tip comes apart into two pieces as well, which means you could easily rinse the brush out for cleaning when you get home, etc.

If I had found this set first I would have bought it instead of the compact set probably but I like having both.  The compact set has more areas for mixing, and has a nice thumb hole for holding on to it which is convenient if you don't have a flat surface to set your paint on, and even a little side pan for water (I use it for another mixing spot). The water brush also fits into the compact set if you wanted to take it along in that.  The thing that I prefer about this set though is that the pans are more separated, AND they fit down into the openings for them. On the compact set there are these little bits that stick out which seem to be meant to hold the pans in if you push them down, but instead I found that they either don't do that at all, OR the pans pop back up flying out of the compact completely. So I've just let them be but then they stick up and jiggle around.In love with this set!In love with this set!In love with this set!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710s7joi3eL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hYWlYKNpL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712jer4VGRL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZoQOi+lqL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iBy4nVidL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

537,"I really, really like this pencil case! I have another pencil case which rolls out, but I don't always have the room to roll out my case and I have to fold it over, which can be inconvenient. This case is nice and compact, easy to carry, and in a color I really like! There are 72 pencil loops in four zippered sections with the first section having 7 varied sizes of loops which can fit an eraser, a six inch ruler, and a few other small items (5 large loops and two pencil-sized loops are on that page). I have a section for charcoal pencils, a section for drawing pencils, and two sections for colored and miscellaneous pencils. I have a short ruler and an eraser in my case also. The elastic loops fit 10 pencils perfectly on each page. I can put my gel pens in them, but the gel pens are a little larger, so I prefer using the case for my drawing and colored pencils. If you use the case for gel pens, you may need to put 5 in each direction or just use 9 pens total in each section.

What I like:
 The case is a nice, compact, organized way to keep my drawing pencils
 It has easy to use zippers and four sections
 I can easily flip from section to section to gain quick access to whichever pencils I need
 I chose the pretty color of rose for my case
 Carry handle for easy transportation
 It has excellent craftsmanship, stitching, and zippers

540,"So just to be clear, these containers aren't 12x12"" - they're just made for 12""x12"" paper (with a little bit of room on the sides).
The actual dimensions are 14 1/8"" x 14 5/16"" (x 3 1/8"" high).

- When storing 12x12 paper, there's enough room on the side of the paper to fit a few pens or other small items.
- The corners jut out further than the sides, which protects the paper corners from smushing against the plastic.
- The plastic is thinner than other similar products but is strong enough to stack a few of these on top of each other and secure enough for paper storage. The hinges are quite strong.
- BPA free and acid-free.
- Made in the USA (the manufacturing plant is in Texas).
- The price is good!

Things I don't love:
- They don't stack. Of course you can technically stack them, but they don't lock together at all.
- The latches don't snap closed which makes them less secure than similar 12x12 paper storage boxes.

541,"I'm a painter working in both digital and traditional media. While I love the tactile nature of traditional painting on canvas, sometimes not having to worry about brushes, cleaning and mixing paints is nice with digital painting. When I saw these I thought it'd be a best of both worlds situations, and it is.

The markers have paint and a ball bearing in them to make sure the paint is properly mixed. You push the tip (it's on a spring) into the marker to load it with paint. A little paint goes a long way and although I was worried that there wasn't very much paint in each marker when I initially purchased them, it's no longer a concern.

Overall what I really like about these is that they are quick. It's easy to get your ideas on canvas quickly and build from them. It has a nice rough style that comes from the layering. They're also great for touch up. I find that I use them on my more involved airbrush paintings to touch up or make tiny corrections, things like that. It's acrylic so it blends right in. Clean up is essentially putting the caps back on the markers. Can't beat it! If your an artist looking for something new to try, this is it!

*Note* I did not buy THIS exact set, but they are the same markers I have bought in other sets or individually from Blick.

Some things to take into consideration:

-When painting you generally mix colors for gradation and custom shades. With these, I layer one  color and then, before it draws, use another color directly on top of the first. This actually produces some nice effects.

-Tips are replaceable, but generally you can just wipe mixed paint off of them.

-SOME markers are refillable (YAY!) The markers in this set may not be(BOO!). I picked up a bunch of single markers from Blick that are all refillable.

-You can refill them with any acrylic. This is great for me because I also airbrush and use Golden acrylic that I can just pour into these markers. Montana also sells their own refill paint. I've been meaning to order some (it's good paint) but haven't got around to it.

-You can buy empty markers and fill them with your own premixed colors or clean out used up refill markers and do the same.Fantastic!Fantastic!Fantastic!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SqxgbyRRL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ugu4Ha3TL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

551,"My big winder was out on loan so I bought this one to wind several lace skeins.  The price is excellent and I do not plan to use it often.  I normally use a U-nitt Jumbo ball winder - I highly recommend investing in that large winder if you regularly wind anything over 50g of yarn... They say this one is good up to 4oz (113gr), but that's really pushing it... Smaller balls, this one is perfect and fast.

First task once this winder is out of the box is to take an emery board and file off all the sharp and rough plastic bits and edges.  Once this smoothing is done, the winder is fairly wonderful.  Several reviews complain about the eye not staying upright and I found that to be true as well until I figure out that I had not pulled it out far enough to fully secure it into place.  If it seems like it is out as far as it should be, but it is still a bit floppy, pull out just a bit harder and it works better.  Once I did that it stayed firmly in the upright position perfectly through all the rest of the skeins.... I attached mine to a wooden cutting board instead of a table and did many skeins right there from my lap while I watched a couple of movies on TV.

Use a swift to keep the tangles at bay, then crank slowly and smoothly and it winds just fine... as expected.  Nice, neat center pull balls, nothing got caught in the gears or went astray.  The key is slow and even cranking while you keep a gentle tension on the yarn while feeding through the eye.Inexpensive and does the jobInexpensive and does the jobInexpensive and does the job",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61s+D-jAnHL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

I thought eh why not take a chance? Luckily I did take that chance! These are now my ultimate go to tools! They fit my hands perfectly and  are sharp with a smooth open and close. The inside of the enclosed box has secure straps that hold everything snug in place...even if one should accidently drop it...twice! All in all This is a great set at a great price!

566,"Works pretty well. I bought it for making hats and scarves for charity, and with a few tweaks, this will serve me well.

1. (Very minor) The plastic yarn needle that should have been included was missing, which is no big deal because I have a dozen of those. Everything else was there and in working order.
2. Most knitting machines come with claw weights to pull down on the knitting, which keeps all the stitches working without glitches. The Prym does not, but I was able to make my own using an 8"" embroidery hoop, paper clips, and steel fishing sinkers. (See attached picture.)
3. Each time you use a new yarn, be prepared to spend a little time playing with tension and making a guage before you try to make a finished piece. Too little tension will give you dropped stitches and lots of frustration.
4. No row counter, so I add markers every 10 rows so I can keep track. Once I know the guage, the number of rows will tell me how long the piece will be.
5. The circle that this makes is really too small for an adult sized hat, but OK for a child size. To make an adult hat, I make 2 flat panels and sew them into a tube from which I can make the hat. This is still *much* faster than hand knitting.Works pretty well. I bought it for making hats and ...Works pretty well. I bought it for making hats and ...Works pretty well.

567,"Why, oh, why didn't I buy the full set? I absolutely adore these watercolors. It gives you control of a project if you want fine details and still allows for making the sweeping color spreads that traditional watercolors are known for....if you use a water pen or brush along with them.
  You will want to make yourself a color chart, however. Since the colors are shown in plastic they can be quite misleading. I've attached a picture of how I labled mine with a hole punch and a drop of glossy accents to hold in place. I just painted a swatch on watercolor paper, going back over it with a water pen to feather out the color, and punched it out with a standard hole punch after dry. The top has a perfect cavity for this this. Now I always now what color it is and how it will blend.
  These pens are perfect for the watercolor paper printed images that are available now for adult coloring or card making with very fine detail. Do yourself a favor and get a set!

568,"I recently started taking my cosplay prop commissions seriously and decided to go big and buy this. Shipping and packaging was efficient and quick. With Prime, it came in two days. The mold came wrapped in a storing bag and a nice booklet with instructions and many ideas.

I only plan to use this mold for cosplay gems used in armor and what not. I waited for my resin to cure for a day and a half and they popped out easily with no mess and a super clean shine. All I had to do was trim off the edge. This mold is self leveling so you can place it down on any relatively flat surface. I really love the different diameters which ranges from 2 inches to 1/4 of an inch as well which can be used for everything from pendants/jewelry to armor pieces.

I have collected some prints, bought a multitude of calendars and puzzles and have stitched various forms of needlework based on his designs.  I have been hoping for a coloring book and just discovered this one (yes, discovered because it was hidden away in office supplies instead of being front and center in coloring books.)

The book is very well made with a good grade of paper.  The cover shows partially finished coloring of a design that looks more like it was done digitally than in actuality.  The designs are printed on one side of the page and the title of the artwork is on the back of the same page.  That's great as they will stay together if you remove pages from the book.  I will list the designs included (in order of appearance) in the comments section below for anyone interested.

The designs are based on Mr. Wysocki's scenic Americana artwork. I was very happy to find some of my favorites, including Peppercricket Farms, Four Aces Flying School and so much more.  The designs are detailed for the most part and some have intricate and small elements.  It's a great book for anyone who enjoys Mr. Wysocki's work or who likes American scenes for coloring.

This is what I experienced while coloring in this book and testing my various coloring medium on the paper:

46 Detailed Americana scenes based on well-known artwork by Charles Wysocki

Designs are printed on one side of the page (with titles on the back)

Paper is medium weight, white, somewhat smooth, and perforated

Glue Binding

Designs do not merge past the perforations

All areas of the design are easy to reach for coloring even while the pages are still in the book.

Alcohol-based markers bleed through the paper quickly.

Water-based markers, except for brush end Tombows, leak through in small spots.  Tombows brush ends did not leak through at all though the fine point tip did bleed through.

India ink pens bleed through to a larger degree than did the water-based markers.

Gel pens did not bleed through but brighter and darker colors left colorful shadows at the back of the page.

Colored pencils work very well with this paper.  It has enough tooth to the page to grab pigment well and allow for layering of the same color to get a deep pigment.  I was able to work with oil and wax based pencils and get good results.  Layering multiple colors and blending using a pencil style blending stick worked equally well.

I am keeping my pages together for right now and, because of that, I am using a blotter page of card stock under my working page.  That keeps seeping ink from marring the pages below.46 Fantastic Coloring Designs based on artwork by Charles Wysocki  printed on one side of the perforated page46 Fantastic Coloring Designs based on artwork by Charles Wysocki  printed on one side of the perforated page46 Fantastic Coloring Designs based on artwork by Charles Wysocki  printed on one side of the perforated page",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qBf8pyLsL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WEWHDyHyL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81K0mG3QkBL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813EbTHVvkL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ceWIn0snL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818B1WdlTXL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s0BY9nDUL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tdEZWHUCL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81A3MFkFQkL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KhSlQSO3L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hsD-mwioL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bhfbMfoyL._SY88.jpg,positive,disgust

UPDATE:  works great with wafer thin dies. Shown are Simon Says Stamp dies. I recommend doubling places like the face to make them sturdier and cleaner-looking.

When I told them I had ordered the Beetastic Face Paint, they were ecstatic. They have bugged me everyday since it came to paint their faces.

The Beetastic Face Paint is a fun set of paints. You get 8 colors - light blue, dark blue, green, red, yellow, white, purple, and black. There are two foam brushes, two sponges and one paint brush. When the set arrives, each circle of paint is covered by a thin piece of plastic. I use tweezers to get the plastic off each one. The paints and brushes/sponges come in a plastic tray that you can use to store them in.

I have never owned a set of face paints other than a small set that came from the Halloween department of a local store and I wasn't very impressed. This is set is much nicer and easy to use. You just need to wet the sponge or the brush and run on the paint. What impressed me the most was how dark the colors were once they were on. I really expected light, muted colors but you can really get a true red or dark black. The sponges really make it so that you can cover large areas, like the entire face, quickly. The brush is a really think tip so you can do fine lines and really get good detail. With 8 different colors, you can easily mix colors to make other colors like pink, orange, lime green, etc... My son has decided he will wear lightening bolts on his face to every soccer game because their team is called Lime Lightening. Once on, the face paint dries really quickly and stays on. My son has wore lightening bolts on his face to soccer and in the sweat, running, etc.. the paint stays on. It doesn't come off with touching.

The paint has not irritated my kids' faces at all. They are both very pale kids with generally sensitive skin and this has not caused any skin irritations, etc... The face paint is easy to remove with just soap and water even when there is a lot of paint. My son wore a red mask and it was on pretty thick. With just soap, water and a washcloth, we were able to get it off in just a few minutes.

I cannot wait for Halloween now. My children are not allowed to wear costume masks to school but are allowed to wear face paint. This face paint will let them complete their costumes with a mask that is painted on. My kids are also into theater so later this month when they do the production of The Little Mermaid I can paint their faces for their costumes (seahorse, turtle, eel). This was the first thing my older kids thought of when they saw the paint. (FYI We aren't artists by any means so don't judge us by the art work you see)

588,"I purchased the 24-Koi set and also the Winsor & Newton 12 pallet travel kit. They are both good startup kits.

Koi pallet is vibrant and not chalky.  Decent for anyone on the go, who wants to do watercolor sketches.  One downside is that I wish the inside of this pallet was a harder plastic instead of a cheap plastic that is used in packaging.  Also I wish the red was red and not so pink.  But overall a decent set for a starter.Good varietyGood varietyGood variety",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LMKoxq3JL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
589,"These are an interesting set of markers. They lay color down fast and heavily, far more so than any other markers we've used. They're double ended. One side is a chisel tip which is stiff and about a quarter inch in width, you can, by turning the pen, adjust the width of the pen. The other end appears to be a simple very-fine point marker but once you start using it you realize it's more like a short flexible paint brush. You can, with care lay down incredibly fine lines or with a little pressure or twist widen and extend the line you're putting down. They're remarkably versatile and fairly comfortable in the hand though the caps are a bit hard to get on and off (especially for my 85 year old mother who loves coloring) other than that we'll have to see about longevity. I'll update the review as or if needed. Right now we're very pleased with this set and the variety of colors included.

590,"Roxy is super cute and very, very realistic looking. She has real (false) eyelashes and her lips look moist, and even her eyes are truly realistic looking. The arms and the head do rotate 360 degrees. The description mentions that there may be some discoloration and that the face may be a little different color than the body ... however, mine is just fine and if there is any discoloration, I can't see it. I purchased this item to use as Halloween and Christmas props. I'm super happy with my purchase.

The only thing that I have to add it that I wish the hands had individual fingers instead of being one solid mold (in case I wanted to put gloves or rings on her fingers); but I guess I could rectify that with an exacto knife.

The mannequin itself is very light weight as she is hollow (8.8 lbs). The stand is glass and is very heavy and very sturdy (approx 6 lbs) .  She came with a couple of little black scuff marks, but they washed away *easily* with a sponge and a little soap and water.

I ordered this item on Oct 11 and it was delivered 4 days later. AWESOME!
The mannequin is GREAT for the price that I paid ($20. + $40.00 for delivery). She was very easy to put together (you do not need instructions); anyone with a tiny bit of common sense can easily figure it out.

Suggestion: put the legs together 1st then attached them to the stand (unscrew the little white screw from the leg brace and make sure the stand post goes all the way up the post and then screw in the white locking screw again), and then put the torso on and then the arms.  Make sure you look at the slots in the arms ... you actually have to kind of snap the arms in place.

593,"I have been looking forward to these for a while but I was unable to find them; then I found them on amazon. These are a great set of pencils! I couldn't wait to try them out! I am a new colorist as I started coloring sometime this summer as a way to deal with stress and my laundry list of health issues that I have. Coloring is a great way to relax, and de-stress; but it is also a great way to pass the time away while you are sitting around at a Drs. office, the Urgent's care, ER. or the Hospital. These pencils lay down color  really great and evenly without having to apply a lot of pressure which is great for someone with arthritis or carpal tunnel (which is something I deal with, I also use functional wrist braces while I color) This makes it easy to shade and blend your colors. I would say that these are comparable to Faber Castell Polychromos but a lot easier on your wallet. I do have a small set of them too; so they are pretty close. These are oil base, instead of wax leads so I didn't have problems with the leads break while I was coloring; and if you are wondering the difference between these the Macro Reniors and the Macro Refines. The Refines are student quality and the Reniors are fine are quality. They are a very beautiful pencil to look at. I am very pleased with this set of pencil. These pencil came very well packed, and arrived very quickly. They arrived in an amazon box, with bubbled wrap; inside another box that contained just the set of pencil (that had room, just for the pencils.) I am very impressed with the packaging with the pencils as I have heard from some people that they have had issues with broken tips or other issue with pencils being shipped. No problem here with that. You won't be dis appointed here.

Disclaimer. I did receive this set of pencils for free or for a discounted rate in return for a honest and unbiased review; however, this had no influence in my review. I am an avid adult colorist who truly enjoys art; and truly loves this set of pencils and will be looking into purchasing the larger set of pencils. You won't be dis pointed.

The butterfly was just a quick little project to try out the pencil, the owl is a current WIP (work in progress) progress, to get a better feel of the pencils and try out more shading and blending techniques; so the I could write a better and more inform review on these pencils; I am really impressed with them.

You have to be careful using them because they are thin just like masking tape is.

For my first crafting project I taped these onto a wooden picture frame that I had been considering spray painting gold but these tapes give the frame so much more character with their fancy little designs. I had no trouble at all lining up the patterns to cover the wood completely. I have been looking online and there are so many uses for this tape and many more very nice designs to choose from.

612,"This face paint came in a professionally illustrated box. Nice presentation.

What I Like about this Face Paint
1. Many times when you get face paint, the attempts to make the designs fail terribly because not everyone is an artist. That's why I love these little stencils, because no matter who you are - you can create cool designs on some child's face. You get several stencil designs, too (25 in all), so there's something for everyone.
2. There are ten different colors, including sparkly gold and silver.
3. You get two face brushes, and three sponges to get the makeup just right.
4. If you go to the company's website, there's more face painting ideas and patterns.

I purchased this Create a Face painting kit at a promotional price for testing and review purposes. This paint set gives me hope that I could do this face painting thing. I have tried before and sort of regretted it (or at least my ""clients"" weren't thrilled), but with these stencils, even I could do a decent job! This is an awesome little set and would make a great gift for a classroom teacher, especially someone who loves to do plays and skits.Love the stencils!Love the stencils!Love the stencils!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31tFu9Lxs5L._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

Great size for lots of applications. In my picture I sponged on a black paint, so the background shows up as the trees.  I didn't get as clean an edge on the canvas as I did on paper but it still worked and looks great.

This is a beautiful and well made product. I was surprised that the box wasn't larger but of course it wasn't delivered fully assembled. Everything inside was individually wrapped and assembly was super simple.

It arrived without any chemical smell. I put this together per the photo instructions and had it together in under five minutes. Unassembling would be equally easy.

It weighs less than 10 pounds so moving it around is no trouble at all. I can easily raise or lower it, as well as spin the top when needed for viewing articles from the back.

Height of Torso: 26 7/8""
Shoulder: 15 3/4""
Chest: 34 1/4""
Waist: 25 7/8""
Hip: 35 1/4""

615,"I grew up in a very crafty household, and my mother used Mod Podge on a lot of her projects.

The classic method for decoupage is to cut out pictures, apply them with glue, then shellac over them carefully building up layers of shellac until the item is smooth to the touch. Mod Podge revolutionized decoupage by making it a lot easier without having to use shellac or thinners to clean your brush.

You use it as the glue, sealer and finishing product, allowing it to dry 20 minutes between layers. It dries water resistant, in fact, some people tint Mod Podge with a bit of acrylic paint or ink, then paint designs on screens in embroidery hoops for screen printing. The Mod Podge acts as a block that is not soluble in the ink.

I like the Matte for a lot of projects. The glossy can be too shiny for a lot of effects, the matte is classy and attractive. Use a foam brush to apply it. I don't work directly out of the jar just in case the item I'm sealing isn't colorfast. That way my jar doesn't get contaminated with color. Instead I pour a little on a scrap piece of paper and work off of that, pouring a bit more as I need it. Using that method, you can use wide foam brushes.

618,"This origami paper is perfect. It's the right thickness, easy to fold, has great fold memory, and makes origami easier. I'm not an origami expert but I can follow a Youtube video pretty well. In my photos, you will see diamonds, butterflies, a crane, a heart, a ninja star, and swans.

This is 500 pieces of origami paper in a cardboard box. This kit has both double sided (color on both sides) and single sided (color on one side  and white on the other) paper. There are also 20 all white sheets. The paper is square and measures 6x6. The paper is thin without being easy to rip. I only ripped the paper once while folding and it was user error as I pulled the paper down in the wrong spot during the tutorial.

There's great color variety. I had no odor issues with my paper. There were a few sheets of paper that were wrinkled, crumbled, or had paint smears on them. I only found 5 pieces of paper that were unusable, out of 500 sheets of paper that's not too bad. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in origami.

620,"This Pack of 100 Flattened Chrome Silver Bottle Caps by Bottle Cap Co is perfect for any bottle cap jewelry or hair bow making crafts. I purchased these 1 inch flattened style bottle caps to use with my homemade bottle cap necklaces and homemade hair bows. I use the Euro punch tool to easily punch a hole for my necklaces without leaving rough edges and I use 6mm or 8mm open jump rings with these when making necklaces but the 6mm are my favorite and work well with these bottle caps. TIP: On flattened bottle caps the hole can be punched through the back (I find this easier). These lightweight but very sturdy shiny silver aluminum bottle caps are new, unused, and unlined. I am sensitive to nickel and have been wearing them for a while now without any redness, irritation, or tarnishing.  The bottle caps are quite nice and are perfect for use with 3D epoxy stickers or resin. I prefer to use them with the epoxy stickers and they really stay put and keep the images clear and bubble free. Also they do not have sharp edges which are important since the necklaces I make are mostly purchased for children and subject to routine handling. I prefer the flattened caps on items for younger children. The bottle caps have a beautiful shine, are scratch resistant, and are much nicer than others that I have purchased previously and they look very nice with ether ball chains or ribbon cord necklaces in stainless steel or sterling silver. I highly recommend these bottle caps as they are high quality and very reasonably priced and I will definitely be buying these again!High Quality Flattened Bottle Caps For Magnets, Bows, And Jewelry!High Quality Flattened Bottle Caps For Magnets, Bows, And Jewelry!High Quality Flattened Bottle Caps For Magnets, Bows, And Jewelry!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61A3oz4hg3L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mVUJuaJmL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

623,"When I 1st purchased this I cut 3 designs, & I wasn't real thrilled w/it because it was difficult to determine which part to keep for stenciling. (User error, buta common mistake when cutting stencils). Then I read to draw a square around your design & that changed the entire process!! I was using other adhesives that were for one use then you trash it.  If you repeatedly use the design this is perfect! I use it for gold & silver leafing w/a spray adhesive & it's perfect! I can use each stencil several times, then I have to trash it but only because of the spray adhesive. If I used non spray adhesives the stencil would last longer (although Im happier w/the outcome using a spray). When using W/paper you'll need to lift the stencil off the paper slowly to keep from tearing the paper. One thing that helped was to take the stencil & press against my jeans a few times (same process Silh users do w/mats that are too sticky) this helped the stencil to lift fr paper without tearing the paper. I have not used it on other surfaces but LOVE it for leafing on paper. I'm ordering it a 2nd time & will continue to use it. I used a blade set at 4 & got a perfect cut. My only complaint, I wish Silh hadn't used clear as it's sometimes hard to see. Although the material they used is very sturdy! A lot of users use stencils for subway art w/wording, I have not used for this purpose.LOVE this adhesive stencil!!LOVE this adhesive stencil!!LOVE this adhesive stencil!!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HVemo1jgL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
624,These blanks are one of the best things to ever happen to me. I use them to make jewelry and my customers love them! The stamps sink into them like butter and they are reasonably priced. The surface can scratch easily so after I am finished stamping paint a thin layer of vintaj glaze over my work and it keeps from scratching. These tags are super lightweight and I can fit all kinds of stuff on them. I look forward to trying out different shapes and sizes from this company. These are so much better than the blanks from hobby lobby (which also cost much more) that are covered in silver which chips off when you stamp them. I also love the size of the hole because I can fit a large sturdy jump ring for some of my more punk pieces. I will add pictures soon.Perfect for stamping. Customer favorite.Perfect for stamping.

In this set you get 12 jumbo size acrylic paints in the colors of cobalt blue, crimson red, lemon yellow, light green, titanium white, burnt sienna, burnt amber, ultra blue, vermillion (a reddish orange pink kinda color), viridian (a greenish cyan color), yellow ochre, black.

The colors are very true to their color and very vibrant and pigmented.  She says they dry pretty quickly and are great for layering or even mixing to get different colors.  It doesn't dry globby or clumpy but it does dry like a nice satin finish.

This is a really nice set that can create so many different paintings or art.  I included a painting that I painted with the set below.  We both completely recommend it!

634,"I bought this compact travel box with intentions of removing the included pigments and adding my own from tubes. The rectangles are glued so well doing so would have destroyed what appears to be a blow molded interior. I think ""sketchbox"" is an accurate name. If you are a plein aire artist and wish to get a quick impression of your area, this is fantastic. The WATERBRUSH is particularly nice. The addition of the little black flower head makes it the easiest to fill of any I have ever used. The layout of the box is great. Many have said they don't know what the sponges are for or they don't use them. They are not meant for cleaning. The best way to clean the brush is to squeeze out plain water then wipe. The sponges are if you are working wet in wet, after you put the initial water on the page, you wipe the brush so that you can go back and mop up any excess water. So the four stars is for two reasons: cheaply made interior, and, the colors themselves. Since they don't actually say what's in them with pigment numbers, I am inclined to believe they are made with dyes and therefore not lightfast. Think of radiant liquid watercolor. Think of Holbein Opera Rose and Bright Violet. They are beautiful colors I use myself. They are fun to paint with but the colors can fade. Best option for these is sketchbooks and journals where the colors can be out of the light and protected. Hopefully when I finish using the color I will be able to replace them with tube paints. How I wish they would make this exact box in metal, even at double the price! Removable individual cups would be a super plus! I like the finger hook on the back too. Box design is ingenious.

The colors are vibrant with good pigmentation and with varied opacity/transparency. I did a color swatch and some colors appeared to be somewhat granulated and does not produce a nice wash. I compared the viridian hue between the pan and the tube and the tube produces a much more even wash and the pan has made strike marks with the pigments (see pic, upper right corner is viridian from tube). This could be because the pigments are dryer in the pans than in the tube and it might improve with more use, I will come back with an update.

Each color was individually wrapped in plastic and a lot of them fell out from the pans. I found it really time consuming and difficult to pick out - unwrap - secure at first then I found out that it's better to just pick up the whole section and push each of the four half pans out with your fingers (saves so much time and protect your fingers! ) The paint cube can easily stick to its half pan if you put a little drop of water at the bottom then put the paint in.Overall a Sleek PansetOverall a Sleek PansetOverall a Sleek Panset",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rsSkBOeHL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719EEdkyqlL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71umAa+nqGL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PPO4Kyr1L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71skz6MpvsL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

These tapes are bright and vibrant colors that coordinate well with each other. They are easy to get started off the roll and while they are sticky enough to adhere well, they are still easy to handle and manuever. You can reposition them if you make a mistake or change your mind. They also tear very easily by hand, although my OCD doesn't like a ragged edge, but if you have a little one that doesn't need to be waving scissors around, it's a good thing. With kids heading back to school this is an awesome pack for decorating binders, folders, notebooks and lockers. There are so many different ways to use washi tape that the options are almost endless. This is a nice pack that will provide you enough for multiple projects.Craft It Up!

656,"When I first got these, I was extremely frustrated, because their pigments are super-fugitiveany amount of water easily results in pigments separating dramatically. If you don't know this ahead of time, and yet for some reason want to do color mixing and blending, be prepared to slam your head against the wall repeatedly.

However, I have managed to get decent use out of these, once I learned how to work around their quirks. If you have these, don't waste your $25 to $38 investment! Here's how best to use them.

If you're into watercolors, a thing to know is that (a) these colors are all transparent, which is nice for certain effects, and (b) almost every color is a staining color, meaning that they (especially darker colors) cannot lift very well. They're not high-quality staining colors at that, because you need to move that color almost immediately with water if you're going to move it at all. Also (c) all colors are fugitive; expect dramatic color changes to occur within even just weeks to finished pieces. Scan in your pieces!

Because these colors are transparent, they actually mix well (see picture 1, a color chart involving 11 of the colors). As a result, even a subset of these colors can result in vibrant, bold colors. However, note that for the most part you want to mix them on paper, like you would with watercolor pencilsa dry-brush of multiple colors and then immediately activating and blending them with water. An example of this is the two peaches (pictures 2 and 3). Cold press and hot press will give different resultstypically you'll get smoother results on hot press and even bristol (picture 4, smooth bristol).

Because these are brush bristles, you can do a lot of fun chinese brush painting techniques, at least for line work and dot worktrying to do color shapes is difficult because these bristles aren't soft or flexible enough to do so. See picture 5. You can also see the ultra-staining, stubbornly-not-lifting nature of the ""rain"" which was originally intended to be a blended gradient background. (P.S. never let people know you didn't intend the effect... this is like 67% of art, at least.)

One of the easiest ways to have fun with these brushes is to use them like you would water soluble pencils or fountain pensdraw the contour, and then apply water to spread out the color deliberately. Combining this with the light colors that don't stain much can result in neat effects. You can get very delicate petals or light glows this way. (Picture 6, the bell flower closer to the bottom of the paper and the gelatinous cube in particular.)

Washes are ... difficult. Waterbrushes like Pentel, Kuretake, and Niji will only take you so far, because their nylon bristles and weak waterflow and water containment aren't up to the taskI destroyed my Kuretake waterbrush tip trying to make washes just 2 inches wide. A much *better* way to go about this is to use a real watercolor brush to apply water. See Pictures 7 and 8 for what you can do with drybrushing and then water on a real watercolor brush.

Now, the super-staining qualities of these colors means that even careful drybrushing can result in unintended dark marks even after applying water. This is the point where you just kind of have to accept that you're going to get color separation through putting marker dye into a palette (just scribble the brush into a little palette well) and picking it up with a wet watercolor brush (waterbrushes do not do well at this). However, with careful practice, you'll learn how to reduce the effects of pigment separation, or at least choose colors where it doesn't look as bad. Plus you can use glazes instead of mixing color in a palette (a surefire way of getting unintended pigment separation in this set). See picture 9 for a dilute madder wash glazed over halfway by a light navy wash.

Wet on wet techniques are fun way to play with these markers as well, as you can tell by the bottom of that same picture, but due to their thin nature, don't expect much body from this kind of technique. You get very wispy stuffeven wispier than normal watercolors.

And finally, picture 10 is something I did using but five colors. (Navy, yellow ochre, yellow, indigo, and madder.) As I said, color mixing is surprisingly good, and their transparency lends well to glazes (if only colors didn't separate so easily). I used concentrated marker dots to represent the flowers on the mossy/grassy rocksalthough this is a place where the transparency does not help.

Anyways, my tips are this: go buy a good watercolor brush that can hold water, maybe a size 6 to a size 8 for doing a good consistent wash depending on brush manufacturer, and go buy good paper (Strathmore at the very least), a little palette, and you can have fun and even produce some neat art.

And praise be that, mostly due to their nature, these colors aren't chalky like cheap watercolor paints are.

I don't know how well other watercolor brush pens work out, whether Akashiya Sai are just horribly cheap or if this is just a common thing with these types of markers. I just know I'm moving to Daniel Smith and W&N tube watercolors now that I know the mercurial nature of watercolors in their most mercurial of presencesthis set in particular. I think nothing high quality watercolors can throw at me will phase me now.How to Get the Most Out of a Too Cheap InvestmentHow to Get the Most Out of a Too Cheap InvestmentHow to Get the Most Out of a Too Cheap Investment",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qCXH0+frL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cHSTeF6QL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UaAnnLKoL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51h6hc9P4mL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618Yrce1RdL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SEyqvihIL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715mBThS-HL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511CQPwbkML._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFRmTScOL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fOz+pdhIL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
657,"This is a review of the Susan Bates 10-inch knitting needles.  While I was on vacation with my 2 sons, a friend taught them to knit.  We got special kid sized knitting needles for them, but the ends snapped off when they dropped them, so I decided to get them some regular knitting needles instead.  So far, these seem to be far better quality and have not broken yet (the others dropped and broke after 1 day of use).  My son has been knitting his scarf (which I was able to transfer from the broken set of needles onto the new ones) happily for the last few days.

661,"Paint Brushes - 15 Pc Art Brush Set for Watercolor, Acrylic, Oil & Face Painting - Long-handle Artist Paintbrushes with Travel Holder (Hot Pink) & Free Gift Box | 1 Year Warranty

Review from Jeannies Product Reviews

This arrived well packed along with some other items in a secure box.
As an artist Im always interesting in art equipment so was delighted to get these for review.

These brushes are long handled. Its personal preference whether you prefer long or short and of course for travel short is better but for the studio I prefer long handles. They just seem to balance better. Theres a good variety of brushes here, from fan, angled and square tips to the versatile round shape. the case containing them is excellent, being sturdily constructed and easy to open.

I like that the tips of the rounds ones come easily to a point making them excellent for sharp lines and definition. Thats very important. The angled and square ends gave a good sharp outline, and all the brushes picked up the paint well. As with anything you get what you pay for, and these aren't going to be as good as pure sable brushes that can cost as much as this set ( or more!) for just one brush, but for most artists these are excellent value and produce very decent quality results. I use watercolours and keep my very few sables for those, never for oils or acrylics because they can be hard on brushes, especially if like me you tend to work large and use texture.

Ive shown on a chart some quick ad hoc experiments I did with these with watercolour paint against my round sable brush and a good quality square end brush, and you can see theres very little difference. ( To be fair my brushes have also been heavily used andthe sableis showing signs of wear at the tip). Id be happy to use these brushes for my artworks.

The sellers also gave me some useful brush care FAQ.

Q: What should I do when I get my set?
A: Always wash your brushes with warm water and a mild soap before using them for the first time. The brushes are coated with a water-soluble treatment for their protection during transit. Washing them will remove the coating and prepare them for their first use.

Q: How should I clean my brushes?
A: Wipe off excess paint from the brush using a towel or rag
Rinse off the remaining oil paint with odourless thinner or mineral spirits.
Rinse off the remaining acrylic/watercolour paint with lukewarm water and mild soap.
Repeat washing and rinsing the brush until the water runs clear.
Shake or wipe off excess water.
Using your fingers, gently reshape the brush head back into its original form.
Dry the brush, handle and ferrule by using a brush stand or the provided holder. Then store them in the holder.

Q: How can I lengthen the lifespan of my brushes?
A: Always clean your brushes immediately after use.
Never allow paint to dry on the brushes.
Never leave the brushes soaking in water for a long time.
Never stand the brushes on their heads.

662,"Faber Castell is my #1 favorite art supplier so far. It's between Faber Castell and Caran D'ache depending on the product but I feel all Faber Castell products are long lasting, reasonably priced, they have high quality control so while Prisma Color is awesome we're all getting tired of uncensored lead and whatnot. Faber Castell never disappoints so when I began getting into water color pencils and crayons I wanted to give their line a shot first.

I was not disappointed. Unlike many water soluble pencils this does not take quite so much effort to get it to spread. You can use a blender marker. Either alcohol or water color, water brushes, a touch of saliva, a spritz or a spray. If the lead broke you could throw water on it and use it as a water cake. You can dip them. You can color swatches and use as cakes and mix your own color palette. There is no end to how to use these.

For me vibrancy is important, but so is longevity. If i really put the scribble down will my pencil need to be replaced free stock already? With Faber Castell it's a no. The quality of the pigments and the level of their soluablity are genuinely the highest of grades. So, while a little goes a long way you can create art with some level of abandon that you're not just wasting art supplies on a perhaps not the best piece. That's the stuff I worry about. And while that's how we learn, they don't say ""Starving Artist"" for no reason. However, reasonably the longevity, consistency, and quality are well within reasonable price for artist grade art supplies. I have cheap water pencils and we have fun together, but it has nothing on the Albrecht Durer pencils. I highly recommend these for any level of water colorist, and will probably buy my own palette at Blick at some point. They're just that good!Watercolor heaven!

663,"If you haven't upgraded your Cricut (or have never dabbled in these cutting machines - then get the Explore Air - sorry for the long review).

I've used the Cricut E1, Circut E2, Sihoulette Cameo, Making Memories Slice. The Explore Air is pretty helpful for last minute projects.

Explore Air vs Explore - Explore Air has bluetooth integrated internally - Explore requires you to purchase the bluetooth adapter. Explore Air is a light blue trim, Explore is the standard Cricut green.

Also - if you  can purchase this in a bundle - do it - especially if you've never dabbled in cutting machines - it's nice to have the variety of materials, pens, mats, etc...and also there's a Frozen bundle. I always do bundles.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

BLUETOOTH / WIRELESS:

You're no longer tied to a cable from the machine to your computer. This is super convenient for my household b/c now it sits on top of a bookcase - permanently plugged in and I can quickly slide some mats in and out and finish my project w/o having to move the machine down onto the table to connect to my laptop.

TROUBLESHOOT - If you're having issues with the bluetooth sync - try turning the bluetooth function on your ipad off and then back on. You should be able to find the Cricut and connect wirelessly. And then you're ready to cut.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

IPAD APP:

The iPad app is super convenient. I can create designs easily. I can also create ON THE GO - and then wait to come home or back to my office and do the cuts. (Long car rides, airplanes, waiting in line, hanging out at starbucks, long meetings - all have become productive time for me).

THE BEST FEATURE on ipad is the orange gridlines. I was trying to lay an image on top of a 2nd. The orange gridlines will tell me if i'm centered the the image, or the center of several selected image. I no longer have to play guessing games and hoping i got it close - or at least .05"" close. I'm now exact!

At a few swipes of a finger I can add shapes/images/text. And just as easily I can delete an image, make it ""invisible"", expand/shrink it's size, change it from cut to score to write. The ipad app has saved me some time in design work. I've found that this app is more versatile, convenient and user friendly as it's intuitive. I find that the ipad app version is easier to use than the web-based. Mostly due to the zoom feature.

SIDE NOTE: I was making minecraft vinyl stickers for my kiddo and we were able to use 1"" blocks to do the character building. He's 6 - he loves it - and it's teaching him a little about xy coordinates and matching photos and some math/grid blocks.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS MACHINE:

This is plug and play (previous versions like the Expressions require lengthy updates and software installs onto my computer. This is plug and play - unpack, plug in power, turn on, sync with ipad, login to cricut app, design.

This machine is also designed for on the go. The bag is great - the handles fit over the shoulder or gripped by hand. The machine is also relatively light. I do take my machine to my kids schools when we have craft time. I get my work done a lot faster than others. (Helps that I have hotspot off my phone, sync my ipad to my phone's wifi - boom, done).

It's super quiet - I have this in my office and people can't really hear the machine when it's going. I do get a lot of questions of what is that? A new printer? (I'm in a challenge right now to decorate my window once a month). (December Xmas Trees, January Snowflakes, Feb Vday and Chinese New Year, March St Patricks, now we're onto Easter Eggs).

It's fast - I was able to cut 18 shamrocks (3"" wide on cardstock) in under 3 minutes.

The new blades are more durable. Pay attention to blade costs on amazon, I've seen a $5 price difference in just a few weeks (up/down).

The smart dial takes the guess work out of the depth of the blade and the speed of the cut or pressure. I don't know about you - but I can't remember what setting I use for Martha Stewart Cardstock vs Michaels Brand vs Cricut if I haven't worked on a project in a while. My older machines have plastic labels to tell me xyz paper is on a xyz setting for the blade.

You can manually customize your settings within the program. So if you're using a special material - then you can do test runs.

Print and cut  feature is Ah-mazing - read further down for details.

This is also the ONLY machine I'm aware of that has an ipad app.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

WHAT I WISH:
The machine should come with a scraper tool - that's a necessity. If you don't have one, check out the Slice (Making Memories) tool kit. I still swear by mine - it's inexpensive and has almost everything you can possibly need. It's also useful to scrape off the little bits of paper on your mat when it gets all gunked up.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

OTHER TIDBITS:
I was talking to a mom friend of mine who said she spent $200 on supplies to make a banner. She had to buy foam letters as a set - and if it didn't have enough of a certain letter, she had to buy another one. She was essentially stuck with what she could get her hands on at the store which didn't really match the sizes she was looking for or a certain design. When I told her about the Cricut, she about died. I could have made her banner for under $20. And probably in less time. What really killed her though - she could have almost bought a cricut for what she paid in materials.

ACCESSORIES:
Cricut by far have the best blades and mats. I've used Cricut mats on my Silhouette Cameo. The adhesive is JUST RIGHT and doesn't kill my paper when I'm peeling off projects. I use the green mats for all my projects. When the green mats get used for a while and there's only a minimal about of stick left, I'll save that as a ""light"" mat and use it for thinner paper or delicate paper.

Cricut is the only brand I've come across that carries the larger cardstock (24x12) which I bought on Overstock. I also like the 24x12 mats for vinyl. I was able to make poster size words on it. And you can get vinyl in 24x12""

If you need tools (tweezers, scrapers, etc.) - Making Memories Slice Tool kit is the best.

Amazon has consistently better prices on blades/mats (you can get in bulk) and also tools compared to your box stores.

Also non-branded generic vinyl is great too! Fraction of the price. I bought a bulk roll of window film (12"" x 25') - that frosted color kind, and cut it down to size to make snowflakes. They were a HUGE hit for school and my office. I've also been able to reuse the snowflakes by putting it onto plastic projector paper.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
MATERIALS I'VE USED ON THE EXPLORE - apparently this is the mother of all machines and I can cut all sorts of material. Challenge Accepted.

FOAM: (Do use a brand new mat - otherwise your foam will unstick mid cut and you will turn into a sailor). The nice thing about this software is that you can still customize your cut pressure. Use the deep cut blade (I've tried variations of settings and deep cut and regular blade before I figured out that I could adjust the setting. DUR. Do know that on one side, it will leave roller marks. So mirror your cuts as necessary.

VINYL: OH EM GEE!! This thing is a dream to cut vinyl with. I uploaded some designs that I found off the internet, uploaded it to Cricut Design Space and it cut them perfectly! My kiddo is obsessed with Mario right now - so I cut out some Mario vinyl and stuck them onto a mason jar - made my own lid insert and voila - instant piggy bank that cost me about $1 each to make. I'm thinking this would be a great way to make personalized party favors - fill little jars with candy, or trinkets.

WINDOW CLING MATERIAL: Cuts the same as vinyl. I've found that Vinyl stays better if whatever i'm intending isn't to be peeled off and re-positioned much.

PENS: I figured since the pens were pretty fine point - that it wasn't able to make an significant drawings - I was wrong. You can set it to run a few times over so it makes a thicker line. I liked that a lot. And it's awesome to NOT have to switch out a pen for the blade - which you have to do with the Silhouette. The computer controls everything - and it's made doing a project effortless and efficient.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A SOLID MACHINE:
The machine needs to be easy to use. And by easy I really mean efficient.  ROI has to be solid (Return on Investment) - which means to me - the time I spend ""designing it"", cutting it, and if necessary, putting it together. The machine has to be easy to use to minimize mistakes - I hate wasting paper - or having to run the same project 3x b/c the mat slipped or a cut didn't go all the way.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I got into the cutting machine world b/c I was into making cards. I liked having the ability to cut a specific shape into a specific size, but that was a phase. The machine has stayed though. Cricut has now become a practical item, like a printer or a microwave.
My most recent projects:
my work wanted branded hershey kisses made in less than 2 days, - printed our logo on address labels - i didn't have sticker paper - and then had the machine cut to hershey size, made a 100 in less than an hour from design to finish - and cost me nothing as i had all the material in my office,
I also made branded magnets (about the size of a hershey's kiss)
help a teacher in need (50 8"" people shapes - it took me 30 minutes to do),
brought a little festive cheer to the office by making vinyl snowflakes and going around the building sticking them to windows
did the same with v-day cards on window cling
I've made vinyl decals for my car
Breakroom word collage that I saw on pinterest but wanted different vinyl colors.
I don't have the luxury of time to run around or go back and forth to a michaels. I also like having control of what I'm creating, or if I see something I like, I want to be able to do it and do it now. And the ipad app lets me do that. NOW!

What made me realize the cricut is worth it's weight in gold? Cutting letters. Did you know that factory cut letters are expensive and more often than not, the teachers are left with letters from these kits that they don't use? At the end of every year for my kid's preschool we made them a box of letters. The teachers were so appreciative of it b/c they would always run out of lettes A, B, C and E and S. As a preschool graduation present - we got them a Cricut so they can cut their own letters - and have the right size, and whatever font they want it in.

If you've never had a machine - you're probably overwhelmed. I know I was when I first started years ago with the Expression as my first foray into this world. The Explore takes the guesswork out of almost everything.

I like that I can do 1 project with little effort and get the kids excited to want to participate. There are tons of licensed materials too - so if you have kids - this is great. (They have FROZEN items now). And the print and cut feature is great for the licensed items - no more having to use 7 layers to make a spongebob. It's print, feed it into the machine, and boom, done!

If you have other machines - it's time to upgrade. The ipad app and the versatility of essentially being wireless (the machine still needs to be plugged in for power) is amazing. The projects are limitless. Yes - this is an investment - but like my girlfriend who spent $200 in material to make the banner, what you save will help pay for the machine itself.

Also the subscription program where it gives you access to thousands of shapes - $10/month - and you're not tied to a contract for a length of time. Sign up for it when you need it. A while back I had signed up with Silhouette for their 12 month program - and realized i spent months not touching it - the credits expired. Money down the drain.

My next project - tattoo paper using print and cut and also printable vinyl. Oh, and glitter t-shirt iron ons.

Feel free to ask my questions. I'm generally pretty good at responding.

UPDATE 3/20/2015:
I feel SOOOO silly for not writing about this. Scoring tool. It's kinda amazing. It's great to create fold lines especially on harder cardstock. I wanted to make those fortune tellers and by using the scoring function, we were able to make them easily. And I used them to make the 3d stars that's a free project. It helps you make sure that the lines are folding at the right angle so your piece matches up.

664,"I got this winder today and I really liked it! I'm nervous due to all the negative reviews, but so far, I've wound a large ball with little issue. My one issue is that occasionally, the yarn slips off and wraps around the center column of the winder. I'm not sure if my tension is too tight or too loose, but I will practice. I'm chocking it up to a newbie error so we shall see. Otherwise, it's really cool and faster than my nostepinne (and easier on my wrists).

Update: I discovered an excellent use for this winder. I'm planning a project that will use doubled threads in two different weights and colors, and I used my winder today to wind the balls of combined yarn. So super pleased, and I've now figured out the tension and have no more issues with slippage.Happy for now.Happy for now.Happy for now.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eailIjTJL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
665,"This pencil wrap came in today's mail, and I have already put a new set of 72 pencils in it.  I haven't used it ""out in the field"" yet, but so far it looks like it is going to be great.

Observations:
The pattern is very nice and would remind you of a Van Gogh or Monet painting--but more abstract.
The outside cover has a texture of canvas but is water resistant or waterproof.
The inside cover looks like it is natural cotton canvas.
There is one loop designated for each pencil--not a larger loop in which you need to cram pencils in.
There is also a flap that can be moved forward or back to expose or cover and protect the tips.
The ties also look to be good quality and are a medium size natural color rope that looks like cotton.
There are strips of elastic at the beginning and end of the row for pencils.  I haven't seen that I can put much that is bulky in them because they bulge out a little bit.
One thing that I thought was really clever was that at the half way mark there is a break and a seam.  This is handy for a couple of reasons:  first, it helps the wrap fold better.  Second, if you wanted to include 2 sets of 36 pencils you could easily do that.  This is one of those details that I didn't know I would need, but I'm sure glad it is there.

At the end of the day, it is a nice pencil wrap.  It won't do your taxes for you, but it does the job it was intended to do, and it does it well.  I was given a complimentary wrap for review, but my review indicates my true opinion and I think it is a good value for what you get.

666,"This set includes 100 sheets of colored origami paper!  The paper is pretty thin - about the weight of normal copy paper.  This would be fun for kids to use for origami or other crafts/coloring.  If you want professional, heavier weight origami paper this isn't it.  This set includes lots of different colors of sheets.  The kids at church will enjoy these!

-Includes 100 sheets
-Various colors of paper

667,"I came home from a trip to find my order of 48 Marco Renoir colored pencils had arrived during my absence.  I was delighted.  I immediately swatched out the colors, and was delighted to find the pencils vibrant and creamy.  Other colored pencils I have:
Prismacolor Premier
Faber Castell Polychromos
Lyra Polycolor
Marco Raffine.

I found these to be among the best (which for me is the Faber Castell Polychromos).  From what I understand they are an oil based pencil that can be layered several times without creating a waxy bloom.  I read on WetCanvas that these are actually the now-discontinued Design Bruynzeel though I cant confirm that as I haven't tried them.

What I liked about these pencils:
Creamy
Vibrant
The tin is good quality
Blend well

What I don't like about these pencils:
Color names aren't printed
Color numbers seem random, not in numerical order in the tin, but ordered by color
They aren't available as individual pencils so if you need more of a color, you need to buy a set.
Can be slightly crumbly.

When I opened the tin, my black pencil was broken.  I subsequently dropped a yellow pencil (25), and the tip broke off, but not all the way.  They sharpened well.  For those wondering what colors are available in the 48 count set, these are included:
01, 21, 25, 19, 22, 16, 23, 18, 46, 33, 31, 11, 36, 38, 71, 70, 09, 75, 39, 56, 59, 57, 58, 91, 55, 50, 51, 77, 14, 68, 62, 66, 60, 61, 63, 27, 44, 79, 42, 45, 73, 88, 72, 81, 74, 43, 40, 10.

684,"Having used a similar canvas pencil wrap, I thought I knew what to expect from this one. For the most part, I was right, however, there is a notable difference between the two--.5"" to be exact.

This canvas pencil wrap is about half an inch shorter than the other one I'm using which means that some of my pencils--specifically, the unsharpened Prismacolor and Derwent pencils--are too long and a bit of the pencil peeks out of the top. (See uploaded image.)

That said, this is also a quality pencil wrap. It features nice, tight stitching; the canvas is thick and durable; and there's a flap along the bottom which protects the pencil lead. Fully open it's about 34"" (not including the string closure), and is about 7.5"" high.

Aside from the issue mentioned above with the pencil overhang, it held all 72 without a problem. There's extra room on each side for peripheral items, but found that unfortunately it wouldn't hold additional pencils (well...it *would*, but they would fall out if the case was tipped), but did fine with thicker/wider items and pens which featured a clip.

It easily rolls up and ties closed, even when completely full. If there is a complaint, it's that the lead protection section along the bottom tends to bunch up as you roll it, but it's a minor inconvenience. It even laundered well (used basic wash, cold water, tumble dry). Overall, this is another well made and quality pencil storage pouch.

685,"I recently bought a pair of pure white, full seat riding breeches on eBay that were badly misrepresented. The seat was ruined and they were not usable. I happened to have another pair of breeches that I didn't like but had a perfectly usable seat, so to try and save the eBay breeches from going in the trash, I decided I'd try and put a new seat on them and dye them a color to match the replacement seat. (Note: I dyed the breeches first and then replaced the seat material, so the seat material you see in the finished photo is not dyed with idye)

This was my first attempt ever at dyeing anything but I figure the breeches were headed for the trash anyway, if I messed them up, there was no loss. The fabric content on the breeches (see photo of pre-dyed, white tag on the breeches) was a mix of cotton, poly and spandex so I bought matching idye color packets in idye for cotton and idye for poly fabrics, as well as a packet of idye color fixative and did the stove top method. The cooking color was very dark but they lightened up after rinsing and drying (which I was glad about). Also, because of the spandex content, I decided to keep the dye pot ""almost boiling"" but not bring it to a full boil like the instructions suggest. I cooked for about 1/2 hour (instructions recommend 1/2 to 1 hour). As you can see from the photos, the results were dramatic!  I now have a perfectly beautiful pair of riding breeches and there is one less clothing item in a land fill! Yay! The idye packets also say it's safe for my septic system - another big plus.

I can't speak for color fastness yet as I've only washed them twice since dyeing them but I do love the color I used (gunmetal, which has a blue base and turned out a deep navy for my difficult to dye fabric). In fact, I love the results so much, I definitely plan on using this method again for future breeches! So happy with idye and highly recommend it.Excellent results with stovetop methodExcellent results with stovetop methodExcellent results with stovetop method",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nu9rQmRzL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c2mzhdOLL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Iiub8fTpL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hGMXL8BML._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

696,"WHile I spent a lot of time with coloring pencils and even watercolors, markers are not my forte. But I wanted to try adding them to some of my pieces and thought that this set of brush markers might be a good budget friendly set to get started with. Turns out I was right. The dual tips let me use them for wider brush strokes, as well as for fine detail work. I sampled them on their own and while they were effective at filling both large and small areas, I tend to prefer something with a bit more texture and blending that markers give. So I started combinng them with my watercolor pencils. Turns out these markers do a fantastic job as a layer over watercolor to add some extra texture. Depending on the colors I use them with the effects were either subtle or extremely bold. I'm including a few pictures of a piece I worked on that I added them to. One picture is without the makers - just painted in, while the second uses the markers to enhance the image, outlining and adding bits of texture to the finished piece.

I'm also including some photos of some experiments I did with the markers on coffee filter paper. I remembered  doing these as a kid and had to try them again and the results did not let me down! These markers were fantastic for that - just draw on coffee filters then add water one drop at a time and watch the colors bleed and mix and create artwork.  This only works with water based markers (you'd have to use alcohol for alcohol based makrers such as Sharpies) and the results can be stunning.

Why 4 stars though and not 5? Because of the color selection in the set. the brown in the set is rather weak - I would have liked to see a rich darker brown - the kind that is suitable for tree trunks. Instead it is a very orangy brown. The dark blue also hovers right between dark blue and purple without seeming to commit either way to one.  I found this rather frustrating. These kinds of colors are a great addition to a larger set, but in something as basic as a set of 12 colors, I expect a good brown and a dark and light blue, as well as a  good purple that isn't too blue nor too pink.  Still, overall I was happy with the set and I'm sure I will use it often.

I was offered a promotional set of these markers at no cost for the purposes of testing and review. All opinions are based on my own use of them and have not been influenced by the seller in any way.Good for addigng texture and detail to coloring pagesGood for addigng texture and detail to coloring pagesGood for addigng texture and detail to coloring pages",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61WcILEyrtL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ugf9dI77L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel._V192234675_.gif; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q54bK8i6L._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
697,"Aside from the 'bad review' given above which had nothing whatsoever to do with the 'Corner Rounder' itself, but rather the 'shipping' of it, I have found this 'Corner Rounder' to be just wonderful. p.s. I received mine in less than a week... and from the same company.

The design makes this 'Corner Rounder' utterly 'fool-proof'. Slip your paper, notecard, picture, playing/tarot card, etc. into the cutter and you will find that the edge-design relieves you of any anxiety you may have as to whether said goods are aligned properly.

It gives a great clean and straight rounding-cut every time.

As an added bonus, there is a plastic piece underneath to hold all the 'scraps'. And, with a plastic lid that pops open so you can easily empty the scraps, it's the frosting on the cake as far as 'Corner Rounders' are concerned.

I've tried other 'Corner Rounders', but this one beats all.

I boiled an egg, crushed it in a baggy, and put several pieces inside, mashing them into the egg, and then sealing the bag. It worked! BUT, the stuff on line talked about leaving them in for five hours. I checked them after an hour, and they were as done as I wanted them. So perhaps the zinc alloy finish gets processed faster.  If I do it again, I'll only use egg yolk, as one site suggested. The yolk did appear to be the active ingredient. A couple of pieces were a little more processed, and we're looking more like antique brass, so that might be an option, too!

In this video review of the Brother Embroidery Machine PE-700II, I want to show you just a few of the basic things you can do with this machine, right out of the box. This is my first embroidery machine, though I've been sewing for a few years now on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-XL2600I/dp/B000F7DPEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother XL2600I</a>, and the fact that I'm able to showcase the basics of this machine when I only received it in the mail yesterday is a testament to how easy this machine is to use. In this video review, I'm going to briefly show how to load a bobbin, how to load the material, how to transfer a pattern from a computer to the embroidery machine, and how to load and change the color spool. I'll also show some projects I finished yesterday, and talk about some potential pitfalls to avoid. (I'd like to show more, but the video time limit is fairly short!)

The Brother PE-700II is a single-use embroidery machine, NOT a dual-use embroidery/sewing machine. The reason I bought a single-use embroidery machine is because it makes sense to me to invest in a separate machine just for sewing, and that way your expensive embroidery machine sustains less wear and tear and lives longer. I've posted a picture of the PE-700II and all the included paperwork and accessories out of the box. The paperwork includes a detailed manual in English, the same manual in Spanish, a ""pictures-only"" manual for quick reference, and a manual for the USB functionality of the machine. The manuals are very detailed and extremely helpful - if you'd like to see them for yourself, I think they are currently available on the Brother website. The standard accessories are included - white thread, empty bobbins, seam ripper, scissors, maintenance parts, a 5x7 inch embroidery hoop and guide, and a nifty plastic machine cover.

For the video, I've selected a quick and simple two-color pattern that I downloaded for free online so that I could show off the USB functionality of this machine. The machine itself comes with quite a few pre-programmed patterns, including the English alphabet in 6 different fonts, but if you're anything like me, you're far more interested in the ability to download millions of free patterns online. Indeed, the selling point for the PE-700II for me was the standardized USB connectivity. I was wary of machines that require special card readers and special programs in order to work - I don't like buying peripherals (what if they break? what if I can't buy a replacement?) and I hate learning new software. The PE-700II, on the other hand, has a standard USB interface which means that you treat the machine as a removable device, as though it were a really big USB thumb drive. The drag-and-drop ability means that I don't have to learn a new software in order to use my machine and, best of all, the USB connectivity is operating system independent - meaning that the PE-700II talks equally well to my Windows XP desktop and my Windows Vista laptop. You can save the patterns from the computer to the machine's internal memory, or you can just hook up a laptop next to the machine, use the pattern, and then delete it from the machine memory right then and there. I cannot rave enough about this feature - I've already downloaded and tested dozens of online free patterns and everything has worked perfectly. The one thing to be aware of, as I note in the video, is that the machine isn't terribly good at sensing which colors are meant to be loaded. You just have to ignore the color prompting and watch the pattern about to be embroidered and feed in that color directly - or follow the numbered instructions that come with the online patterns. You can reprogram the pattern, once it's stored in machine memory, to have the correct colors, but I never felt it was worth the trouble. (UPDATE: I've since loaded these free patterns into a separate program in order to print 'actual sized' templates of the patterns, and the same ""wrong"" colors are loaded into the program, leading me to believe that this isn't a flaw in this embroidery machine, but rather in the source program. Interestingly, the ""non-free"" patterns tend to have correct color charts, so I suspect that the free ones just weren't polished fully before release. Again, just pay attention to the pattern on the LCD screen and you should be just fine.) A quick mention of formats - this machine accepts .pes and .dst formats, which I've already found an abundance of. (UPDATE: And there are several free conversion programs out there that I've found that will convert patterns to .pes and .dst format.)

Loading the Bobbin: If you've used a Brother machine before, this is easy as pie, but even if not, it's a quick learning curve. For embroidery, I just use the white thread on the bobbin for everything. I didn't have video time to show how to wind the bobbin, but it's pretty easy to follow the user manual for this, and there's also cheap bobbin winding machines like this one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SideWinder-Portable-Bobbin-Winder/dp/B001MEDT1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SideWinder Portable Bobbin Winder</a>&nbsp;if you want to be really spoiled rotten. Be certain to wind the bobbin carefully - as in sewing, a tangled bobbin will cause your pattern to muck up and will bring the bobbin color on top of the pattern by accident.

Loading the Material: The machine comes with a 5x7 hoop, but it also accommodates the other Brother embroidery hoop sizes. Ideally, you want to use the smallest hoop that will work with your pattern, so as to avoid wasting material and stabilizer, but in the video I use the included hoop. The machine doesn't come with any stabilizer, so be sure to have some on hand so that you can get started as soon as your package arrives. You can buy stabilizer anywhere you buy fabric, and it's usually about half as expensive as the cheaper fabrics. The stabilizer does what it sounds - it provides stability for the fabric whilst your machine is rapidly punching hundreds of holes into it. In the video, I'm using a medium weight stabilizer.

Loading the Hoop: I can't rave enough about how easy it is to use the embroidery hoop. I've been cross stitching for years, and opening and loading the hoop feels like second nature. Just unscrew until loose, drop the fabric into place, pop the inner hoop in, tug the fabric taut, and screw to tighten. The 'snap in place' feature for inserting the hoop into place on the machine guide deserves a quick mention - although the hoop DOES snap-in-place, the snap action is subtle, so don't go crazy trying to force a loud crack from the machine because you won't get one. Basically, the ""snap"" is a half-feeling, half-sound that you half-sense. And while that may sound confusing and intimidating, I can assure you that I was completely comfortable with the process after my first three or four loads.

Loading the Spool: Loading the spool is so incredibly easy with the automatic threading feature. If you've ever loaded a sewing machine before, you will have no trouble with this; if you haven't, I'm guessing you'll have it down perfectly in less than five minutes. I'm going to miss the auto-threading when I go back to regular sewing on my other Brother machine.

Pausing the Pattern: Once the pattern starts, you can pause the process at any time for any reason. Need to trim the thread tail because it's sticking up out of the pattern instead of sticking out the back? Press the Start/Stop button to pause the program and trim away. Need to check the bobbin because you think it's getting low? Pause the program, lift the foot lever, cut the current thread, pull out the hoop, and check the bobbin level. You can replace the bobbin, if necessary, then pop the hoop back into place, lower the foot, and continue and the machine won't miss a single beat.

I cannot rave enough about this machine. It's easy to learn, easy to use, it practically does everything except wipe my nose for me, it has cheerfully used every downloaded pattern and every type of thread I've fed into it, and the LCD screen is actually surprisingly easy to navigate, considering the natural limitations of a computer stuffed into an embroidery machine. The ONLY issues I have had with it so far was one time when the white bobbin thread leaked through the pattern onto the top (I had wound the bobbin too sloppily and the bobbin thread was tangled) and another time when I ran out of bobbin thread and wasn't paying attention in time to switch out the bobbin and the resulting pattern was incomplete - and you'll notice that both of those ""problems"" were human error on my part. I hope my video and pictures will be useful to others and I had a very fun time putting them together.

UPDATE (08/23/09): Still as happy as can be with my embroidery machine. I've gone back through the user manual more thoroughly this time and found that not only can it automatically stop when the bobbin or spool is running low, it's also very easy to go to a specific portion of a pattern - you can even move the pattern stitch-by-stitch until you get to *exactly* where you want to start, or re-start as the case may be.

Another neat thing I've learned is that the little boxes in the upper left hand corner of the machine represent the three Brother hoop sizes most commonly used with this machine - and when a box is ""grayed out"", that indicates the pattern is too big for that hoop size. Very neat! I definitely recommend picking up the other, smaller hoop size (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-SA443-Medium-Embroidery-Hoop-100mm-x-100mm/dp/B001TOY2O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother SA443 Medium Embroidery Hoop 100mm x 100mm</a>) for embroidery monograms and names on clothing and sheets - the smaller hoop is much more manageable, in my opinion.

718,"I used these paints on plain glass salt and pepper shakers to create a set with an ombr effect. It was for a wedding gift and the couple loved it. I feel the results were good.

So, all's well that ends well, as the saying goes, but this paint set did give me some headaches before the final product.

First of all, using the plastic tool that comes with the set was a miserable failure. It's nearly impossible to spread the paint with it. So, my first attempt ended up as a mess. I had to wash the glass and start over.

On the second attempt, which resulted in the attached picture, I used a brush. It wasn't even a paint brush; it was a unused makeup brush I had sitting around.

My paints weren't hard when they arrived. They were nice and liquid. But, the tops, once opened, are fiddly and the fact that the pots are attached was a little annoying.

Keep in mind, too, that the color in the pot may look quite different when dry. So, that's a hit or miss experience.

All in all, I really liked painting glass and will do it again, now that I know the major pitfalls. I'm happy I bought this set.Worked well...in the end.Worked well...in the end.Worked well...in the end.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-kOMpa22L._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

Then what you do is put one on each container in the center to where it will then be easy enough to sit the wick piece on top so that it stays in place.

727,"I actually thought all glue guns were a standard size, and took standard  glue sticks, but I guess I was wrong.....This is actually a smaller glue gun than the one I'm replacing, and it takes glue sticks that are a lot smaller in diameter.

The fact that you get 25 long sticks is a real plus---they're definitely lengthy, at over 10.5 inches.  The drawback of this is that the extra length protruding from the rear of the gun is a little unwieldy, if you're trying to do something fiddly and small.

The flip down stand that comes with the gun (detached, requires assembly) is a little flimsy, though.  It's just a single piece of bent wire, and it's the kind of thing that doesn't hold the glue gun far enough away from the floor (which is where I do all my crafts!)  I get around this by putting a shoe box lid under the whole thing to contain the long strands of flyaway glue.

I'm happy with this glue gun.  I don't know that it really stands out from the multitude of other glue guns on the market, but it definitely gets the job done---so can't complain.  The only change I would like to see is a longer power cord.  This might not be an issue for some people, especially if you're doing small scale projects, but if you're working on something large, the short tether gets in the way a little.

I'd use these mainly for larger oil or acrylic canvas work because of the size. I prefer smaller, detailed brushes for my watercolor and face painting work but these could definitely work in a pinch. The brushes feel still at first but that's just a way for them to hold their shape while traveling. You just have to wash them before use and they melt into soft and very manageable tips.

I particularly love the travel case. It pops up to make drying very easy, and they fold nicely into a zippered traveling pouch so you can move sites with ease.

737,"This is stamp and die set is perfectly sized to create nautical themed cards, scrapbook pages, and crafts. I purchased this set along with the Tonic Studio Tim Holtz's Stamping Platform and decided to use these stamps to test the platform. To get my impressions of the platform navigate to that page, or click my name to see my reviews.

I stamped, die cut, and embossed all of the dies and stamps to test them and over all I am pleased with the results. I initially tested the embosslits by die cutting them and then running it through with just the embossing rubber. It created a double image (not shown). So, I ran it through again only cutting it and learned that the embosslits embosses wonderfully with the cutting plates in my Cuttlebug (see all three images).

In Image one:  A: is stamped first (with the stamping platform) and then cut, B: is just cut, and C: is cut first and then stamped (with an acrylic block). Due to the size of these stamps, I think I will stamp first and then cut, since I didn't see a real difference. I just need to practice aligning the die better over the stamped image.

Image two: A: I stamped this with the stamping platform, I ended up stamping it three times and didn't get overall coverage. B: I hand stamped with an acrylic block once, on the platform and got pretty good coverage. C: I used the embosslit in the middle of the die.
For the stamped text, :""The Adventure..."" I think I will stamp it after I cut the frame out, as it proved to be difficult to align the die over the stamped words correctly.

Image 3: all of the stamped images and die cuts.

Clipped around the strap and they are an excellent way to keep your keys from being buried on the bottom of your purse, or from getting lost when you aren't carrying a purse. They are very stiff when you first used them, but will loosen up in time. Note... Not for fabric, the tip is large and blunt. Also these pins can also be used in place of the swirly clips used to keep hitch pins in place, in fact they work better than those old style hairpin clips, easier on, easier off, and can't come loose by accident.

741,"This is a fantastic brush for washes, general painting, and even detail work. The ""crimped"" fibers (new to me) seem to hold a lot more water than most brushes this size and works well for an all-over wash like a mop brush. The point is cut very fine and does marvelous detail work, too. After you've used the brush for a mop and the fibers are splayed out, just give it a quick twirl on a piece of cloth or paper towel to restore the point. Perfect! The brush cleans easily, dries quickly, and works just like new even after a rough workout.

I made a quickie 2-minute watercolor to show the range of this brush--it's not very artistic, but gives an idea of what this brush does.

745,"I love these paints. I use them over the other paints I have time and time again. These come with 48 half pans, but some colors are repeated. I also like that the second palette space is detachable for saving some space on my small art desk. This set did not come with a brush. I put a small medicine dropper in the little space so I can drop water into the pans or to transfer colors or washes on my palette. I also swatched all of them out on the watercolor paper I typically use and laminated it and keep it in my palette box. They are in the order I keep them in my palette. Hopefully you can see the dark to light variations.

I bought these as an upgrade to my Reeves student grade tube paints, and it was well worth it, they are still not artist quality, but they were a nice step up from the Reeves.

I have owned this palette for nearly a year now, and haven't used all of the paint yet. I have seen the replacement pans online for around $3. They also sell the cotman tube paints at major craft stores for $4-$8, depending on the color. I plan to buy the artist quality pans as I run out of the pans, so eventually I will have a 48 half pan artist quality set, but I won't have to pay for it all at one time.My favorite paints!My favorite paints!My favorite paints!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yZqXW-lTL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oWFLOT4nL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hXCd9B5yL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wpsTGrWgL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

749,"Both items are packaged together. The watercolor pencils are packaged in a clear plastic case. The canvas pencil wrap comes wrapped separately. These watercolor pencils come pre-sharpened. There are 36 colors in this set. 4 browns, 2 gray, 1 black, 1 white, 3 purple, 5 blue, 6 green, 4 yellow, 3 orange, 4 pink, and 2 red.  The shade variance between each pencil offered is nice. I wish there were more reds and oranges. There's really only one true red and two true oranges.

These watercolor pencils have a soft core. They are less waxy and chalky than standard color pencils. Each color lays down in a soft matte finish. When you run you wet paint brush across it, it gently spreads the color. It doesn't take much water to spread the color. A small drop at a time is ideal. I accidentally put more water on a part of my project and had excess bleeding. It's easier to control the bleeding if you use less water.

For light coloring, I gently colored the dry paper. For heavy coloring, I colored the dry paper with a heavier hand. For heavier, more bold coloring I ran the pencil over the paper while it was wet. You can easily work with the pencils to create your desired outcome. I used US Art Supply's watercolor paper.

The pencil wrap is well made with no loose threads or seams. The elastic was the perfect elasticity. It was easy to get the pencils in but not so loose they fall out. It has 28 pencil slots and one larger 1 1/2 inch slot. It has a faux leather flap you can push the tips of the pencils into. This protects the tips from breaking during travel. The strap was the appropriate length to easily fasten the button closed. The button is easy to open and close.

Overall this watercolor pencil set met my expectations. It works exactly as it should with no quality concerns.

754,"The item arrived in a nice vinyl storage case with a flap to hold the brushes inside.  The first problem I noticed is the seam on one side of the case was torn 2/3 of the way down.  The barrels were easy enough to fill from my kitchen faucet.  I pulled out my pan paints to test the tips.  To use water pens, one needs to squeeze the barrel to fill the brush with water. Brush #1 and #2 tips leaked water continuously, even without squeezing the barrel.  The rest of them held paint pretty well and did okay for making squiggles and lines for testing purposes.  I tried painting a doodle flower and they didn't perform as I would've expected.  I have some other water brushes that perform much better.  I really am disappointed since the assortment of tips is what attracted me.  These would probably be good for children, but not if you're an adult or aspiring artist.

Edited 8/18/2016:  I received a replacement set from the company due to the above issues.  As much as I'd hope I'd get better results, it just didn't happen.  After testing them, none of the pens in this set dripped constantly.  There were three problems with these though.  1) The #10 flat brush was broken where the cap screwed onto the base.  I think another reviewer had this problem, too.  2)  The brush tip on the #7 flat splayed during painting and even after cleaning would not go back into shape.  3) The same thing happened with the #3 tip.  I have to stick with my original comment that these should be geared toward children and not adults or aspiring artists would want better consistency and control over their brush strokes.

I paid full price for these and was not compensated in any way for my review.  I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the excellent customer service provided by the company.

765,"I've bought this 60 set POLYCHROMOS tin through some other online store @ decent price plus 6 additional colors in open stock (Burnt carmine, Alizarin crimson, dark flesh, light flesh, cinnamon and copper) .Actually i tempted to buy 120 color set but many castoffs or near identical colors you can't differentiate in 120 set .so this 66 colors are more than enough for me.
Many prismacolor enthusiasts are complaining about hardness of this pencils, I wonder this is pretty soft with oil based leads need different pressure application than prismacolor. The color output is very detailed deep and more natural than prismacolor,however prisma's are more vivid and unnatural but you can achieve realism in prisma's depends on artists.
Coming back to quality
1. This pencils are unparalleled never ever face a single breakage even using cheap quality sharpener.
2. To achieve very fine details this is your go to color pencils, (prismacolor is horrible while sharpening).
3.plenty of natural skin tone colors like all 3 flesh colors(light,medium,dark)also cinnamon,pompein red, burnt carmine,burnt ochre,sangiune,walnut brown etc. are excellent for portraits pretty much  match with prismacolor skin tones.
4. Come back to red's this Faber castell polychromos have the widest range of reds among all the artist grade color pencils even better than prisma.for example this dark red put prismacolor's crimson red in to shame also red violet, magenta, scarlet, madder all are gorgeous indeed true colors, However prismacolor's Tuscan red is unique brownish red is better than polychromos burnt carmine.
5. Come back to greens this polychomos had many natural greens like chrome green opaque, olive green yellowish, pine green, light green all re superb for natural floral drawings.
6. This 60 set doesn't have much browns and greys only walnut, Vandykes, burnt ochre, raw sienna and 4 more greys compare to prisma it's very less but in 120 set you can get full range of browns.
7. Polychromos black is the deepest black color pencil even better than Derwent drawing's black, but white is not as opaque as Derwent drawing or prisma,polychromos white is translucent more suitable for classic look on toned papers.
8.it's more value for money than prisma actually because of this pencils sturdiness in lead it will not wear out so easily, so it's 3 times more lifetime than prismacolor.but price wise its expensive than prismacolor(132 prisma set sold for 97$some time back compare to 96$ polychromos 60 set)

Overall it's very very high quality color pencils with marvelous deep color application suitable for artist to amateur(i personally advise don't waste this pencils for adult coloring etc because for adult coloring plenty of cheap color pencils will give you same result) this pencils are meant for professionals or semi pro.

768,"I've used Iris 12"" x 12"" Scrapbook Cases for years now for all sorts of projects and storage needs.  I've used them both stand alonestacking them nicely and also in their storage towers made to fit these cases.  When I bought my last sets I realized they had redesigned them and the quality had been reduced.  The plastic seems thinner and the closure is definitely less secure, and requires two hands now.  As usual, quite a disappointment when you find a product you rely on and they decide to make changes that reduces the item's value rather than add to it.  Still, between the old design and the new I own about 60 of these puppies... they're a go-to storage solution!

I've included a photo showing one of the newer cases atop a stack of the older design... there is quite a shift in design.

Even with the new changes I still give these cases a good rating.  I have however had a few breaks now (closure, hinge, and one entire case shattered all in separate occurrences) though my old ones are still holding up beautifully.  I'm not fond of stacking the newer ones, they just don't seem able to take as much stress and they slide off each other much more easily now being that the new 'nesting ridge' around the top has a slightly lower profile than the original design, providing less grip to the the box above. However, they do stack nicely in the towers that are sold separately, though they then take up more space.  The old ones I could stack 6 and even 12 high depending on what was in them and still feel comfortable.

Designed to hold the average 12"" x 12"" scrapbooking sheets of paper and tablets (which always seem to be a little larger than 12 x 12) their outer dimensions are actually  14.5"" x 14.5"", a bit confusing if you're not a scrapbooker.

A sort of carrying handle has been added to the new design, and I suppose this might be great for some situations, but I find it's too slippery to be of any real use.

Now that all being said, they are still fabulous for:

-Protecting your scrapbooking paper (especially those smooshable corners!) and supplies.
-They are BPA and acid-free!
-They're USA-Made!!!  How about that :)

Be careful stacking them, make sure you have two hands free to open them now, and handle them a bit more gently and they'll do you a beauty.

769,"I like these brush pens so much that I'm slowly expanding my set. They have at least three purposes that I've discovered so far. First, as water-based dyes, they can be used much like regular watercolors. That said, I'm pretty sure they are not light fast (unlike most colors of the Winsor and Newton Watercolor Markers), so that is a consideration if you want a painting created with these markers to remain bright over time.

Second, given their ability to make very small to larger, thicker marks, they are very useful for adult coloring books. And since they are water-based, they do not bleed through all but thin paper (e.g., copy paper or slightly heavier) paper.

Third--and I haven't heard this mentioned much (if at all), I really like these markers for doing brush lettering. That said, it does take awhile to develop adequate control of the pens. But hand lettering does take considerable practice to get proficient and that includes using these markers.

Another feature of these markers that I haven't seen noted elsewhere is the fact that they have the color on the bottom of the marker, which makes it very easy to grab the right color when they are stored upside down. And these colored ends have good fidelity with the ink color, unlike some other markers.

I have tried to point out features of these super little pens not covere (or covered much) in other reviews. I hope it is useful.Excellent Quality and Versatile but Bit of a Laerning CurveExcellent Quality and Versatile but Bit of a Laerning CurveExcellent Quality and Versatile but Bit of a Laerning Curve",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719kMDJZC4L._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

This is a set of 12 paints that are .4 ounces each. It contains a good variety of colors that are bold and vibrant. The paints do not come sealed which is something I did not like. They are already opened and exposed to air when they arrive. They do have a box that you can keep them in and store them in when you are not using them. There is no brushes included so those will need to be purchased separately.

The paint comes out of the tubes easily. It has a nice texture and is not watery. You can easily mix the colors to form other colors as well to create an endless number of color combinations. The paint easily washes out of the brushes as well as the tray. It is non-toxic and safe for children to use as well.

It is a great set of paints for beginners and has all the colors needed to make some great masterpieces. I am happy with this set of paints and my children are really enjoying them.

791,"This is a heavy weight paper that can be used for zentangling or zendoodling with markers or for water colors. I have been using both sides for watercolors and have been using it as my journal for my outdoor sketches and it works very well for that purpose.

The paper is slightly textured and holds paint well. I can scrub a brush with a little paint on it and it does not flow too much so I can quickly create sketches using strokes and more transparent washes. It dries pretty fast too. I put a couple of washes on it and it did not pill although I could tell that by the third wash it would start to pill a little. Still, it's great for quick watercolors given the value.

There are 22 sheets in this pad and they are half the size of a regular letter paper sheet, it's a convenient size to make smaller sized sketches or paint flowers or smaller objects.

The minute I received it I did a test with a Koi watercolor set and I have uploaded that image, for my very first sketch it did not let me down!

799,"I got the set as a Christmas present from my husband, and it is so cool! It comes all ready in a Boye case (mine is red with black trim, it zips up and opens like a book) which is plastic but padded on the inside and textured as similarly to leather as poly-whatever-it-is as possible. It does have a little plastic smell, like a kid's vinyl doll, but it isn't strong and eventually will go away.
The needles are all pretty sharp and well-made, in sizes from 2 to 15 (US), and while the sizes are not marked on the needles themselves, they each have a numbered spot in the case. That might be a minus for some but doesn't apply to me (I have a gauge ruler for derp moments). The cords are plastic and need some flexing but after the first few rounds of stitches anyone should be good to go without a problem. Make sure to use a key and the gripper to attach your needles/connectors and they will not come unscrewed! I made the mistake of just screwing a cord and tips together by hand alone and every once in a while it would start to come unscrewed. OOPS!

Well I hope this was helpful/informative!

811,"I wanted these pencils since March!  I tried them out in several different coloring books to test the way they work.  They ARE  a good pencil however I do have several cons that I feel most of the other reviewers didn't mention.  I did receive the 150 ct of pencils which is what I ordered.  I received them early which was awesome!
For reference I have used Faber Castell Polychromos, Prismacolor Premier, Prismacolor Veritthins, Marco Raffines, the White Luminance from Caran D' Ache, Crayola and CrazArt colored pencils.  I think these are good but not to the standards of the Polychromos or Prismacolor Premiers.
They do come with some awesome colors.  They have 2 blacks (lamp black and black), as well as two whites (white and soft white)  The soft white is the best white I have came across!  I have bought the individual Luminance white from Caran D' Ache, which prior to buying this was my best white.  This soft white is indeed soft!  it seems softer than a crayon.  Whats great is even after you have another color down it will still show up over the top of it!  Much like the Uni Ball Signo White gel pen, or the Gelly Roll White gel pen!  But since it is so soft you use it quite fast so be careful!!
 They have a great selection of greens, blues, purples, and pinks.  They are sadly lacking in greys and browns.  I had a hard time coming up with good skin and hair colors which was unfortunate.  You think that you are getting so many pastels that you never find in other colored pencil sets but once I took them out of their original case and organized them by color (I'm a little OCD) I found that you don't really get a huge difference between the brands that are out there.  I will show this in my pictures. In the picture with my color charts Prismacolor (has 150 colors) is on the left, Holbeins (has 150 colors) are in the Center and Polychromos (has 120 colors) are on the right. I also made a color chart according to their list hopefully you guys can copy that if you want to.  I rearranged it to my specifics (color-coded) so that I could show you how alike in tones to Prismacolor and Polychromos they are.
I use the T'Gaal pencil sharpener and found that they sharpen nicely and hold a point as well as the Polychromos.  They do hold a point longer than the Prismacolors which are softer.
I was a little disappointed in there ability to blend!  I am heavy handed with coloring so that may have had something to do with it although I don't have trouble blending with Prismacolors, Polychromos, or Marco Raffines.  I could not get more than a couple of layers down without great difficulty.  For example on my Jasmine Griffith Beckett coloring (the purple girl) I tried to get it to blend but it kept tearing my page (see pictures!).  I thought the picture had been ruined :(.  But I managed to save it with some workable fixative that I have.  I sprayed it and let it dry then touched it up.  I did find that with my other picture on the cheaper create space paper (it's like copy paper) it didn't tear no matter how much I colored (just make sure to put paper under it cuz it makes dents!).  I believe that this is due to the fact that these pencils are VERY opaque.  Once you put one color down the tooth of the paper is pretty much flat and doesn't want to take any more color.  This is fine for some colorings like my Doodle Invasion picture but for a picture with people it is very difficult since you need to use many colors to get it to look realistic.
Also I like to make individual strands in my hair when I color people and I could not get these pencils to do that!
They don't sell them individually so when you run out you would have to buy the whole set again which is crazy expensive!
Overall I would recommend these pencils despite the downfalls!  I will just use them with my Polychromos and Prismacolors to get them to work to their best abilities.Very difficult to blend but beautiful colors!!Very difficult to blend but beautiful colors!!Very difficult to blend but beautiful colors!!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+1Re24dNL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KEM0KP5SL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hoJibFSML._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vEqLOph+L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81anaSlbvhL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WehRkzc5L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vWQ4kq8BL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j13147CTL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BqS1rhXCL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Sx5Yj0s5L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Iavk8DLZL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TDJx7skdL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8189+TggGSL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rhK9APajL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VVYkYB9eL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81179JBBsKL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71neB+D0vnL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NUYjT0JiL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jZWUYfPGL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R3JcYX8gL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

817,"Save your money, it bleeds.  I burnished the tape twice to be sure it was on the paper as best as possible. This tape had ""lines"" on it that reminded me of duct tape but when pulled from the roll this were no longer visible. I compared three tapes for a project. I am making an extensive color chart for all of my watercolors for value, intensity and mixing colors.  I need a lot of tape for this project so testing different kinds of ""artist tape"" or delicate surface painters tape was the best way to find which would better suit my needs.

I compared this Scotch 1/8"" ""artist tape"", 3M 2080 (blue) 1/8"" tape and 3M 2090 (blue) 1/8"" tape. The 3M brand is for delicate surface painters masking tape. The picture below will show you my results with the three tapes.

The noticeable difference between these tapes when using them:
Scotch Artist Tape 1/8"" - on the roll you can see faint lines but when pulled from the roll they disappear. This tape is plastic and tearing it is not hard but instead of a tear it is like pulling on a thin plastic grocery bag and the adhesive is no longer active where the tape was stretched from trying to ""tear"" or pull the tape.  applying it was easy and the adhesive was a nice tacky strength for watercolor paper. I knew that if it kept the paint from seeping underneath it would be a nice choice (if the price wasn't so high for such a little roll) I paid just over $5 with prime shipping.

3M 2080 (1/8"") and 2090 (1/8""), both I paid under $3 with prime shipping. 3m 2070 and 2090 were very similar with only a few noticeable differences. Both blue in color the 2090 was slightly darker and tackier than the 2080. Both were very easy to tear and easy to lay down. I burnished the corners of the tape were they overlapped. Just with the scotch artist tape I burnished each brand exactly the same except I did it twice for the Scotch tape because I didn't feel good adhesion like the others until the second time around.

I used 140 lb Cold Press watercolor paper and different values with a Cobalt blue deep.

I decided to use the 3M 2090 for Cold Press and the 2080 when I need to use Hot Press because it is again slightly less tacky and from testing that particular one on the smooth surface it gave me the results I needed.Save your money.Save your money.Save your money.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X69KLqjDL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

They are really sharp, I tested them on materials all doubled and they cut right through the material, fast and clean cut. These scissors can be used for hair, crafts, material and paper. They are rust resistant. I definitely recommend these scissors, they are awesome.

826,"This review is not for the quality of the inks, but the choice to put two very similar colors in the same package. The Butter Bar is no yellow. It is very similar to the Orange Soda which is also in this set. I would've preferred a more yellow and not yellow orange. And the soft granite is darker than the product photo shown on Amazon.Would've preferred a more true to yellow for Butter BarWould've preferred a more true to yellow for Butter BarWould've preferred a more true to yellow for Butter Bar",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618juqCQZxL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XEY6PqWnL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
827,"The best designed 36-half pan palette with mixing area I've ever found. Because the colors come in their own plastic pans nestled inside individual wells, I was able to take out the water brush/sponge/dish from the center area and move the plastic half pan trays there. I popped out the paints that came with this set so I could use the trays. This creates 36 spots for paints in a wonderfully designed tray for custom color mixes using other brands of watercolor paints in tubes. No other tray I've found has been so perfect for this use.

I did also keep one of the trays I ordered filled with the paints that came with this set. They were better than expected for this price, and now I have a bag full of refill paints from the trays I emptied out. It's a great set for families/sharing painting time with friends/or practicing painting. The color selection was varied and vibrant.Recommend for custom watercolor trays filling with your tube paints, holds 36 half pans.Recommend for custom watercolor trays filling with your tube paints, holds 36 half pans.Recommend for custom watercolor trays filling with your tube paints, holds 36 half pans.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SyVdjoUnL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

829,"These are great rivets, but they can be hit or miss, quite literally. The set includes a mini anvil and setter (that you smack with a hammer) that work great...as long as you get it perfectly centered over the rivet when you hammer it down. The rivets that I meticulously aligned and *very carefully* hammered look beautiful and professional, on the front and back of the piece. However, the ones that I got lazy with turned out absolutely horrid. They bend to the side and out of line VERY easily, which can result in bent caps and crooked, off center sets. I try and use the shortest post' I can get away with, as it helps with the bending and tilting :)

There are three sizes in posts included, and two sizes of caps.

All in all, these really are beautiful and hold incredibly well.Great rivets, but easily bent out of shapeGreat rivets, but easily bent out of shapeGreat rivets, but easily bent out of shape",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PDaFt58XL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611gEIy65GL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610i1LRulhL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510ltvNLxDL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619zdpvkf6L._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

832,"I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local library and have collected hundreds of different dies over the years.  I have found that Die-Namics dies work with all major die-cutting tools on the market.  They are a good size for A2 greeting cards (5.5"" x 4.25"") and cut very well on my Spellbinders Grand Calibur machine.  I personally think they cut better than the Spellbinder dies.  I have used at least one of my Die-Namics dies well over a hundred times and it still cuts sharply.

These party balloon dies can be used to decorate a variety of different A2 (5.5"" x 4.25"") greeting cards, including birthday and graduation cards (see customer image for a graduation card I made from one of these dies).A useful die for birthday and graduation cardsA useful die for birthday and graduation cardsA useful die for birthday and graduation cards",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51p6D-Ka8UL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness

835,"Horrible product. Leaves a white residue after completely drying. Not as advertised where they say it dries off clear. Also the glue is not strong after it dries. It's more of a sticky resin than glue. After 24 hrs of drying the shiny white residue is sticky to the touch. Used it for an arts and crafts project to stick colored  rice to a design. This spray glue does a bad job unlike the original Aleenes tacky glue.
The picture below was a test before I used it on my main design. As you can see it left a white glitter like residue after 24hrs of drying. Rice is clumped like I used some honey instead of glue.
I do not recommend this product. Will be returning mine for a refund.Dries off white, more of a resin not a glueDries off white, more of a resin not a glueDries off white, more of a resin not a glue",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pkLvgx9IL._SY88.jpg,positive,sadness
836,"Great wash tape. If you know anything about wash tape you know they are small rolls of thin decorative tape that are used to embellish craft projects. They are naturally thinner than the Ducklings which have recently become popular but are mini duck tape rolls. Personally I love washi tape for all sorts of projects including crafts and decorating but they are particularly great for scrapbooking (which I don't do) and card making. I will attach a picture of my most recent card for you to get an idea of the size. The green dots behind the letters is also one of the washi tapes. You can get very creative with what you do with it.

Enough about washi tape in general, specifically I like this set. There were a lot of great colors and prints that would lend themselves to all sorts of projects and holidays. I like neutral sets like this so that I don't have to get a ton of tapes for each specific holiday or season, for example the green dots were great for Christmas but would also be great for any project and any season.

They are thin so the background color will seep through a bit so be mindful of that if that's a problem for you. Personally that doesn't bother me any, I think it makes it blend better, I like the more subtle look it provides rather than the loud pop of color.

All in all great set of tape. I can't wait to do more projects with them!Great washi setGreat washi setGreat washi set",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uABZaiFOL._SY88.jpg,positive,happiness
837,"I absolutely LOVE these pencil cases! Pencils are easy to insert, are held snugly and are well protected in the case. I also use the case for Gel pens and Sharpies (fine and ultra fine point). With the fine point sharpies you have to skip a slot between each pen as they are to fat to fit side by side. This is not a problem as I don't have 72 sharpies. The case also has room for a sharpener, eraser and a blender pencil. When zipped up they fit side by side on a shelf like books, when using them I can have the just laying on the table or I can have them standing on end for easy visibility of the contents.  I have purchased 6 of these cases so far and have been happy with all but one. That case came from a different seller.

838,"Like most artists, when marker paper is labeled as being ""bleedproof"" I expect it to be as such. Since I am primarily focused on mixed media, I have multiple brands of markers, pens, pencils etc around, and I decided to test if the paper was truly bleedproof.

I used Tombow, Copic, Mr. Sketch, Memento, Sharpie, Spectrum Noir, Crayola, Martha Stewart, Staedtler, Gelly Roll, Sharpie Paint and Prismacolor markers to test. The good news is that most of the markers didn't bleed through. The bad news is that the Spectrum Noir, and Prismacolor did. Obviously they didn't go completely through, but if something is marketed as being bleed proof, I expect it to be such.

I was bummed that the book didn't hold up to my test. It is a nice size for travel and the printed pages are a nice starter for doodling or sketching. The pages are nicely perforated, and come out easily; the back of the book has a nice pocket in which to store your pictures. It is a substantial book, and I'll use it now with my colored pencils. If it hadn't been marketed as having marker paper, and being bleed proof, I would rate this sketch book much higher. However, since it was marketed as such, I have to down rate it, as it doesn't do what it claims to do.Not recommended. Not Bleedproof.Not recommended. Not Bleedproof.Not recommended.

But upon its sticking to the skin well, at first, within a few minutes, they seem to fall pff ... one by one. So as far as advertising it for the skin usage ( for this of you who are face artists) , it's a no- go.  And since they are all way too small to use glue underneath it's base, using any kind of glue will be extremely messy and unappealing. So stick to using it on paper .

-Colors: Free description states that the colors are as shown in the picture. I received 2 repeats and was missing 2 colors. That's disappointing and goes against their description. If it said random colors or something, I wouldn't mark down for this. I think it's important to be honest with advertising though.
-Quality: This is by far the lowest quality of washi tape I've used. They are not very sticky (I'm posting a picture where you can see it lifting) and are very thin. They are pretty see through. They still work for most of my purposes though.
-Size: These are smaller than I anticipated, but for the price it's not a big deal. Just expect something small!
-Price: I paid less than $2 for these. I think they are mediocre rolls, but for the price they are worth getting. Just don't expect certain colors or high quality.

Overall, I can't give them a high rating because they are misadvertised as being 10 colors and I only received 8 colors. Still worth getting to have on hand for crafts and decorating.Repeat colors.

885,"This one-hole punch in tiny, measuring in at just 1 1/2 inches. See my photo of punch against tape measure for scale. This is not a little scrapbook quality punch. The casing is made entirely of low-quality thin, transparent plastic and the stainless steel pieces are very thin and low-quality as well. This is a Dollar Store product all the way, having seen it in person now, I would expect to find it in a two-pack had I purchased it there. I was hoping for a little scrapbook quality punch, given that I purchased it as an add-on, which usually are a decent quality product that reflects savings for having grouped it with an existing, qualifying order.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baumgartens-Mini-Hole-Punch-Assorted-Colors-BAU20270/dp/B001KVRHFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baumgartens Mini Hole Punch, Assorted Colors (BAU20270)</a>&nbsp;I ordered two, one was clear and one was a transparent royal blue. This will break easily if jumbled around in a binder pouch or backpack.

 This states it will punch through 5 pieces of paper, and it will. It will NOT punch through a standard weight recipe card, which is what I purchased it for. The cheap thin index cards, it will punch through those one at a time.

 BOTH PLASTIC CASING AND STAINLESS STEEL PARTS ARE CHEAP QUALITY - Think Dollar Store, Not scrapbook quality.

 TRAY THAT CATCHES PUNCHED PAPER FALLS OFF - A flimsy, soft, plastic tray attaches to the bottom of the punch. It is loose and falls off. It holds the punched out dots, does't hold many, and when it comes off they fall out.

 LITTLE CLEARANCE BETWEEN PUNCH & BASE - Clearance is minimal between punch and base. Although it will punch through 5 sheets of paper at once, it is difficult to feed 5 pages between the punch itself and the base. Scrapes across paper.

 OVERALL - This isn't going to hold up over long term, regular use. If you need it for now and then, this may work out for you. About the only thing I can think of that these would be ideal for is if you have a birthday party craft project where each child needs a punch of their own, to save time, and you send it home with each child in their favor bag afterwards. Other than that, this isn't a practical punch for repetitive use. If you have any questions leave them in the comments and I will be happy to answer.These Are Not Scrapbook Quality.

My only complaint is if you're doing a stitch that requires several loops on the hook, such as a puff/popcorn stitch, there isn't as much room on the hook as you would have with a normal crotchet hook.

This review presents the comparison of the thimbles along with images of how they fit.

Clover Leather Thimble set is made out of hard leather on top and plastic insert under it (the pink part). It is comfortable to wear, but the string that holds it together broke the first time I tried to use it (I was able to fix it by sewing it together). When I saw it in the store I liked its shape and thought I could use it to protect the tip of my finger (see photo of how I wanted to wear it) but they don't get much use as found something less fragile that works better.

I am attaching comparison and pictures of the thimbles in my collection.  The numbers in the images correspond to the numbers below.

1. Leather thimble with a metal plate (marked #1 in the photos) is my favorite, most versatile thimble. Because it is leather it become shaped to your finger and gets more and more comfortable with use. The metal plate on the tip allows to push through and not hurt your finger. It does not have an opening at the top, so it may not work for those who have long nails.

2. All leather thimble (marked #2 in the photos) is extremely comfortable, but because it has no metal parts it provides less protection. I often use it as a second thimble on the hand to protect another finger because it does not get in a way.  It has an opening at the top, so it works for those who have long nails.

3. Strip thimbles (marked #3 in the photos, the product in this listing) turned out not to be very useful.  The leather itself can be penetrated by the needle, the pink plastic insert does protect the finger. However the string that holds thimble together on the back broke very quickly.  I was able to repair them by stitching them together on the back to replace the string that broke.  As you see from the photo they don't cover the very tip of the finger, so they did not work well for me.

4. Plastic thimble provides good protection, but hard plastic makes it a bit hard to work with.  So I usually put it on only when my needle is stuck and needs an extra push. It has an opening at the top, so it would work for someone with long nails.

5. Thimble #5 is a thimble I made myself out of band-aid wrapped around my finger. I needed to protect my thumb, and my home made thimble worked best.  If you have hard time finding a good thimble, give it a try making it yourself out of Nexcare bandages.  They seem to hold the shape well, and I could put my home-made thimble on and off, so I could re-use.

6. Thimble #6 was a thumb thimble I bought, but I found that it got in the way because it was a bit too long and made my hands less agile. It has no opening at the top, so it might work for people with long nails.

So if you have to buy one thimble I would go with leather thimble with a metal plate.Broke quickly, did not protect wellBroke quickly, did not protect wellBroke quickly, did not protect well",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DLSZZ0dAL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51u2dn49lcL._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness

962,"I've been looking for something like this and was happy to purchase it.  It works great at holding cakes of yarn as well as regular skeins.  I especially appreciate it for some of the more floppy styles of skeins.  I use it in crochet and find that the slight tension it puts on the yarn helps keep my gauge accurate.

The one problem I have encountered (and why this review is a 4 instead of a 5) is that some yarns, especially boucle and soft twists have a tendency to snag in the openings at the base of the spindle.  I'm not sure why those are part of the design as I can't think of any reason for them.

To solve the problem, my first fix was that I used blue tape and carefully applied it so it would cover the slits completely (otherwise they would continue to snag.) After a few skeins, I found that the tape started to peel off.  My next fix has worked well and has stayed on through at least 30 skeins with no problem.  I used some of the press and cling wrap plastic (available at the grocery store) and pressed it on and trimmed it to fit.  That has solved the problem for me.  I will try to upload some pictures to show how it looks once in place.

This tool has made a big difference in my use of skeins.  I had always pulled from the center except with cake style yarn.

974,"The colors are great but they are not good value. There's only about 1600 sequins total in their package. I determined that after separating the sequins into the Darice 1992-89 Clear Bead Organizer with 12 boxes (containers). I had purchased 600 packs of sequins from another vendor and when comparing the total of one 600 pack container to a container of one color from the Craft Medley pack I determined that it was approximately one third of the amount or 200 sequins. So 8 colors yields about 1600 sequins. Pretty colors but just very poor value.

The other issue as others have mentioned is the packaging. It literally took me hours to separate the sequins into separate containers (I bought all the color combos). The containers are shallow and you have to lift the lid very carefully or they all jump and spill into neighboring containers. If you are moving the sequins I'd recommend using a small teaspoon to scoop them up and transfer them. I'd prefer if these sequins were packaged in little baggies so they could just be poured into a container.

I added a picture so you can compare. On the left are approximately 200 x 7mm pink sequins from one section of the Craft Medley sequins and on the right are 800 x 5mm multi-color sequins from another vendor.Pretty but just a small amount of sequinsPretty but just a small amount of sequinsPretty but just a small amount of sequins",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816vdFzjHCL._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness
975,"I was definitely excited to try these out. I am still playing around with them to get them to work for my purpose. What I wanted to do was emboss my handwriting exactly, or at least close to it. I found that if I wrote using my handwriting it didn't emboss really well, it was like my letters were too close together and didn't look right when I used embossing powder. I'm going to try using fine detail embossing powder and see how it works. I was also expecting them to have a more detailed tip to them, they are more like markers than pens. I really like them, I'm just seeing how I can get them to suit their purposes.

~EDIT: JULY 2ND 2013~
So I've had these sitting around for a good year without use. I took them back out again a month or so ago and played around with them. I found that I can use my stencils, coloring them in with the clear embossing pen (marker) and get a great result. For me, this pen (marker) gives me better results than I ever had even when stamping with Versamark. No lumps, bumps or unevenness. I did find out that I CAN emboss my handwriting, and well. You have to be deliberate, exact, and give space between each letter. I recommend practicing on scrap paper with the markers so you can get a feel for it. If you decide that you want to go over your writing a second time before applying the powder, you'll definitely want to make sure your letters are really wide apart. I found that it looks like crap if I go over it for a ""second coat"" before applying powder.  Same applies for using cursive (do they still call it  that nowadays?) So these markers and Distress Embossing Ink are the only embossing inks I will use.Not quite what I expectedNot quite what I expectedNot quite what I expected",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hiwoqRx8L._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness

982,"As a watercolor newbie, I wasn't sure what to look for in a watercolor brush vs a standard synthetic paint brush. I happened to see this at JoAnn's one day and decided to pick it up. That was mistake number one - buying before researching. These waterbrushes are pretty cheap, but I could have bought 1 good waterbrush for the same price.

Let me explain my problem with these. First and foremost, don't plan on filling these up before you head out. They will leak and you will have no water to use with your watercolors when you are out and about. Not a total deal breaker if you are willing to plan ahead, but it takes away the portability I was looking for. My Sakura water brush holds water just fine. I am able to fill it up in a sink and throw it in my bag.
Second gripe is that the brush ""points"" do not last. At least, not on the medium and large brush. Once the initial coating is wiped off (all brushes usually have this coating on them), they lose their form. It becomes a very dull, rounded brush. And lastly, these brushes may shed on you. The brushe fibers are not held in there very secure and they come lose and move around as you are cleaning or refilling the brush. The large and medium brushes have become to jagged and I haven't even used them for very long.

To its credit, the small brush seems to have held up just fine. So far it hasn't lost its shape or point and the fibers are intact. And I used it (along with a sakura waterbrush, Sakura Koi travel 24 pan watercolor palette, and Fabriano watercolor paper, cold press, 140lb) to create this mini painting during a lunch break.

I've been crocheting & knitting for ""57"" Years. . . . and I  didn't know what to do! No instructions were included.

I had to Google it to see what to do! I Measured  a section W/ the 10 stitches it said to do & the pointer pointed to ""nothing!"" [On the space above the pointer!]

It was a third of the way past the 2.5 mark, heading towards the 3, So what did THAT mean? The 10 stitches between the pointers was 3.75 inches (which I had to get a RULER to get ""that"" answer!) Then.....I had to get a calculator to divide 3.75 by 10, which was 2.6 [sts per inch]. So ""that"" figure is what the ""blank"" spot the pointer was pointing to, which was not clear, but a guess!

I could have achieved that answer by simply measuring 3.75"" by 10 sts & GOT the same result  MUCH faster!

It ""does"" have the needle size holes across the top of it, so I ""may"" keep it in my ""large"" knitting bag, because it IS large, thick, & doesn't fit into small project bags.

991,"Garbage. I'm not sure how winsor and newton series 7 quality can differ so much. I bought a size 8 from Amazon. It splits with varying degrees of water in it.

I've noticed my escoda reserva splits, but only with lower degrees of water in the brush. When saturated it's perfect, but as the water is removed it splits. But my series 7 split literally sopping with water. When it was damp it looked like Albert Einstein. See photos of brush with varying levels of water and splitting.

With all this said, I do have a couple smaller  series 7 brushes that are fine - 0, 1, 2, 4 and 1/4 flat. But once you go above a 4 it's over. The 8 I bought from Amazon and the 10 I bought from Jerry's were both garbage and returned.

Do yourself a favor, get a da vinci. Their quality far exceeds series 7 but most importantly when you spend the money you will consistently get a great brush.

1006,"I'm writing this review one hour after I used this machine for the first time. I only passed my sandwiches through the machine SIX times and THIS is what happened!! (See photos.) I have been a paper crafter/stamper for over a decade. I have been using the Sizzix Big Shot for the past 8 years. I teach a card class once a month and do a LOT of die cutting. I thought the Gemini would help when it came to prepping for class. NO. I read through the instructions over and over again. I even typed up a spreadsheet so that I didn't make a mistake with my sandwich. I followed the instructions TO A ""T"". Here's what happened... I only cut with the dies that they sent for free with my machine. I was too afraid to put my OWN dies in the thing. Even though I was only cutting one sheet of basic-weight cardstock, the machine moaned and groaned as it fed through, cracking and popping all the way. I tried to hit the reverse button, but it didn't work. That was also concerning. I would think that if a sandwich is too THICK that the machine would spit it back out at you, but sadly that wasn't the case. I ended up with MAJOR WARPING on the clear cutting plates, the metal shim and the magnetic shim. When I tried to emboss with a die (the instructions tell you how to do this), it cut ALL THE WAY through the rubber shim on the first pass. Tore it to pieces. Here's another thing that happened that was TOTALLY CRAZY--I attached my spreadsheet on the machine with 6 pieces of scotch tape. It was perfectly flat against the machine with no gapping. When the sandwich fed through the machine, it was twisting and warping my spreadsheet to the point that I thought the tape was going to give way!! When the sandwich fed through, the spreadsheet went flat again. As far as how well it cuts the dies...it's total crap. Using the recommended sandwich, it STILL didn't cut every piece of the die all the way through. It took me 3 times as long as it should have to poke the pieces out of the paper with my piercer tool.
Bottom line - if someone gave me this machine for free, I still wouldn't use it.
P.S. I bought this item as a PRIME listing (2-3 days shipping, right?), but when I would track it, it said that my item would arrive on a certain day, then they postponed the delivery date 3 times. After 10 days, it still had not arrived so I called Amazon. They said that it was shipping from overseas and that was what was causing the delay.

I use this as part of my field sketching kit. I have a 5x8 watercolour sketchbook that i clip to a memo sized clipboard from Wal-Mart. Then at the top/bottom of it, I have 2 of the fridge magnets that (1) I have this palette on and (2) one of those little plastic clip on palette cups.

1059,"Before I discovered these micro pop dots from All Night Media, I was cutting up the quarter-inch adhesive squares from Scrapbook Adhesives, in order to fasten very small decorations to my greeting cards.  That was hard on my scissors, and a bit frustrating because I still couldn't cut the squares into really small pieces.

These micro dots solved my problem, and 'pop up' small decorations on my cards, giving them a three-dimensional quality.  See customer image above for an example of a birthday card that has 15 micro dots adhering to the lizards' feet and tails.

These dots aren't perfect.  They're a bit hard to pry up.  I finally developed a method of squeezing down the matrix around a dot while simultaneously prying up the dot with my fingernail.

1060,"It was tough deciding between one and two stars, because the yarn itself wasn't to horrible to work with, but in the end the fact the skeins didn't match won out.

The yarn does seem to have a loose ply so during the first sock it did split a bit, but not unusably so. The second problem skein did have some seriously frayed and almost broken plys.

I really liked the all over tweed look of the first sock so excitedly jumped into sock two. However I fairly quickly noticed a rather huge difference in the colors, after about 1/3 of the second sock I realized there was a good chance the whole thing would be way off and decided to roll the rest into a ball. Without a doubt the two socks would not have come close to matching.

The first sock had a green strand that went through all of the plys, which is what really gave it that ""tweed"" look that I so liked in that sock. The second skein looks like it might have had the same thing, but for some unknown reason it appears to have been over dyed. So instead of a section of say mostly blue with a touch of green, the same sort of section in the other skein would be relatively solid a blue with maybe a slightly different shade strand of blue. Which means it doesn't look tweed like at all. When I rolled it into a ball I found a couple of seriously ugly muddy parts.

Maybe the fact that skein two had so many slightly damaged areas means the over dying is a way to mark the ""bad"" skeins. Either way, they shouldn't be sold with the exact same dye lots.

Luckily for me I bought 3 skeins, worrying that two wouldn't be enough, and that third skein looks to Matche the first. I'm extremely disappointed.

The ball pictures show just a couple sections to show how they were solid instead of multi colored with a green strand.Same dye lot, yet vastly different.

1075,"The colors are great but they are not good value. There's only about 1600 sequins total in their package. I determined that after separating the sequins into the Darice 1992-89 Clear Bead Organizer with 12 boxes (containers). I had purchased 600 packs of sequins from another vendor and when comparing the total of one 600 pack container to a container of one color from the Craft Medley pack I determined that it was approximately one third of the amount or 200 sequins. So 8 colors yields about 1600 sequins. Pretty colors but just very poor value.

The other issue as others have mentioned is the packaging. It literally took me hours to separate the sequins into separate containers (I bought all the color combos). The containers are shallow and you have to lift the lid very carefully or they all jump and spill into neighboring containers. If you are moving the sequins I'd recommend using a small teaspoon to scoop them up and transfer them. I'd prefer if these sequins were packaged in little baggies so they could just be poured into a container.

I added a picture so you can compare. On the left are approximately 200 x 7mm pink sequins from one section of the Craft Medley sequins and on the right are 800 x 5mm multi-color sequins from another vendor.Pretty colors, awful packaging, poor valuePretty colors, awful packaging, poor valuePretty colors, awful packaging, poor value",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816vdFzjHCL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

1079,"I purchased this for my family. My husband, our three teenage daughters, and my mother think it's lovely. It arrived quickly and thoughtfully packaged. For the most part, it works beautifully. Unfortunately, I have a couple complaints. My main complaint is regarding the quality of the bamboo brush, or lack thereof; it needs improvement. Also, I think it's overpriced ($35). The bamboo brush just wasn't cutting it. For starters, there's a crack in the bamboo. Granted, it's a tiny crack (for now). I'm uncertain whether the bristles are synthetic or natural (likely nylon). They're soft enough, but hold little water. I have similar brushes that work significantly better than the brush included. We've had the best luck with a water pen brush. You know the kind... the barrel is a reservoir of water and you squeeze out desired amount. I highly recommend a water brush if you get this board. Aesthetically speaking, the brush included completes the set. Pragmatically speaking, the brush included doesn't allow long, fluid strokes. It simply doesn't hold enough water. All that excessive stopping and dipping harshes my mellow. For the price I was expecting better quality. Admittedly, it is pretty amazing and I don't regret the purchase. It's really fun and relaxing. It's an awesome gift for all ages.

1093,"While these pencils are not the best, they are certainly not the worst.  They don't take a lot of pressure to lay down color and can be layered a bit for shading.  They sharpen well in my electric sharpener and stay sharp for a while so you don't have to resharpen every time you finish a small section of your page.  There are some pencils that are extremely close in color (greens) and there are several different shades of pink which is normally hard to get in some inexpensive sets.  That being said, there are only 2 pencils that I would barely classify as red.  One of those is more of a red-orange and the other is a dark pink/cherry red shade.  I really like using red in my coloring so, to me, that is the biggest flaw in this set.  The other thing I would like to see is the color name, or at least a number, imprinted on the pencils.  I got around that by using a Sharpie marker and numbering them myself and tying them to my color chart in that manner.  Since I don't mix different brands of pencils when I color, this system works well for me.  P.S. In the pictures, I have only shown part of the pencils and only 1 page of the color chart just to show my numbering/reference system.NO TRUE RED PENCIL IN THIS SET :(NO TRUE RED PENCIL IN THIS SET :(NO TRUE RED PENCIL IN THIS SET :(",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hJcj3DDlL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QYuBqeSFL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812jBaoKC5L._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness

This didn't get one star because the picture is so beautiful.

The paint is pretty much see through and the numbers are printed in a very deep blue ink that's very hard to cover up. I have some pictures shown. The green is two coats and you can still see the numbers. The cream was, believe it or not, four coats!! Yes, you can still see the numbers!! How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?!

Right now, I'm at the point where I'm either just going to throw it away with nothing done on it, or I'm going to get out my other paints and see if I can get the numbers covered and use my own coloring. If i Do that, I will post a follow-up picture. I'm not sure any paint will cover up the numbers with one coat. Gesso maybe. But I would hate to Gesso then paint. Seems to be a lot of unnecessary stress for such a cheap paint-by-number.

1132,"I want to be very clear, I am not complaining about the size of the yarn; I'm complaining about the quality of the yarn, and the consistency of the product within one single package.

First off, the yarn in my package is fuzzy and splitty.  It's very thin for supposed sport weight yarn; going off looks alone I would have guessed it to be closer to fingering weight.  (I noticed another review calls it sock-weight yarn, so I'm not the only one who finds it thin.)  Even with that, the suggested hook size is 5.5mm--for comparison, that's also the recommended hook size for Red Heart Super Saver yarn, which is probably three times as thick as this stuff.  The knitting needle size is only 4mm.  There is not typically such a disparity between suggested hook and needle sizes.  If you use the recommended hook, you're guaranteed to be left with a sloppy, floppy disappointment.  The first picture I'm including is of some of the red skein.  It is NOT out of focus; the yarn is just fuzzy.

Now, the inconsistency problem.  Second photo is of 7/8 of my little skeins (I didn't think to take a photograph until after I'd used the red).  You can sort of tell from the product photo that they're not actually all the same size; it's more readily obvious in my photo.  The package claims that each skein of yarn is 28 yards.  The bright orange is visibly larger than the others.  The yellow didn't seem smaller, but nevertheless turned out to have less yarn in it than both the red and the light orange.  I was able to get a nice 6-round granny square from both the red and the light orange (which worked out to about 4.5""; see the third photo), with some left over, but the yellow skein came up short with half a round to go.  I've been crocheting for 25 years.  I am not a novice.  This is not an issue of inconsistent tension.  It's an issue of inconsistent amounts of yarn.  I actually felt bad for planning to leave a three star rating right up until I ran out of yellow yarn.

Here's my last issue: the colors don't really coordinate.  I don't know if this is an issue across all the colorways or not, but it is here.  The red and purple are fairly dark and rich.  The green and blue/teal are lighter but still fairly similar.  Then there are inexplicably three neon colors (bright orange, yellow, and pink) and the other orange is almost a pastel.  And why two shades of orange?  It's not red-orange or yellow-orange plus normal orange, it's neon and pastel orange.

I went ahead and cut down the PrimeCuts vinyl sheet to 8.5"" x 11"" and ran it through with a cutting blade, just as though I was cutting card stock.  It worked okay, but next time I'm going to follow the instructions that came with the Silhouette and leave out the cutting mat and use the transfer paper.

Vinyl cuts much cleaner lettering than card stock if you use it correctly.  Please see customer image for an A7 (5"" x 7"") graduation card, where the phrase 'Ace Graduate' is cut from PrimeCut black vinyl on my Silhouette Portrait machine.Works okay with my Silhouette Portrait electronic cutting machineWorks okay with my Silhouette Portrait electronic cutting machineWorks okay with my Silhouette Portrait electronic cutting machine",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511e4r8UAAL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

1140,"I am not very happy with this elastic. Overall it is not what I'm used to when I was buying similar 1.25"" sports elastic by the yard from fabric.com or in small quantities by Dritz from Walmart or Joann's

What I'm disappointed in:
-Overall consistency is not there. There are random ripples, its not straight, its just cheaply made.
-Strong odor. It has a deep unpleasant rubber smell to it. I'm not happy about that either.
-Worst of all: It's dirty off the roll! Gross. I've had to throw pieces out, as its dirty, on both sides. This is inexcusable.
-Cost: At the price I paid for this, it was over a $1/yard. The quality and value is not there. Overpriced junk. I was purchasing a far superior product from fabric.com for a fraction of the price, but its been on back order for quite some time now and I needed more. This stuff was a mistake.
-The stretch isn't as good as dritz or others I have previously used. Disappointed in that too...

Overall if I hadn't already cut a few pieces before noticing how poorly made this was, I would have returned it. I didn't notice the dirt until about a yard or so in after I had made cuts. I do not recommend this product and I will not be purchasing it again in the future.Overall disappointing, cheap junk thats visibly dirty off the roll. Cheap junk.

1159,"Used for it's intended purpose and this would get 0 stars, I read many reviews mentioning shattered plates... as soon as it arrived I inspected it and the base plate should fit full into the recess in the base, mine does not. It's cut just a tiny bit too long and too wide... so if you have one corner flush the other 3 are raised up. The uneven pressure that would result if rolling it through a machine would definitely cause it to shatter/break. I'm not even going to attempt to use it as it arrived as basic physics tells me this would happen. I would request an exchange but Amazon doesn't appear to even be selling these directly anymore (ordered mine 2 days ago, said there were 3 left), WeRMemoryKeepers site is down, though I have an email in to them. I might try carefully sanding down the plate myself.

That said, I bought this to use as a more affordable and larger version of a very popular (and crazy overpriced) stamping positioner. For that you don't need to use the base plate, so it not fitting doesn't really matter to me. It works PERFECTLY as a stamp positioner. The recess even allows you to add a Little B perfect positioner or to cut down a thin sheet of magnetic material to hold your card base in place. The large size means I can stamp a card open or use a larger 5x7 card. The hinge is also floating, so unlike when trying to use a modified clear CD case you don't have uneven pressure. I'm thrilled with my choice in using it as a positioner, and highly recommend it for that. If I can get a replacement correctly sized base plate, or manage to sand it down myself, I'll report back as to how it works as a letterpress.5 stars as a stamp positioner, 0 stars as delivered as a letter press.

But my series 7 split literally sopping with water. When it was damp it looked like Albert Einstein. See photos of brush with varying levels of water and splitting.

With all this said, I do have a couple smaller  series 7 brushes that are fine - 0, 1, 2, 4 and 1/4 flat. But once you go above a 4 it's over. The 8 I bought from Amazon and the 10 I bought from Jerry's were both garbage and returned.

1247,"Final update: after not spinning at all and not spinning even after I loosened the knob and parts (because it just kept tightening every time I spun it) I took a small round metal file to the hole of the spinning unit and scraped around until a few little metal shards came out. This did the trick and it now spins beautifully, even with the extension attached. I'm leaving it at -2 stars because I had to deal with all of this AND because some of the dauber handles are falling through thr metal arms and I have to keep tightening them. Other than that, it's a nice spinner haha. Man I'm exhausted.

Original review:
I love my Ranger inks, I love my Ranger blenders, I love my Tim Holtz dies, I love every single thing I own associated with him and Ranger and Sizzix.. with the exception of the decorative strips I can never seem to get cut out properly. This ""spinner,"" however, I guess I'm asking for some advice from fellow owners because it falls extremely short of amazing. For starters, I had an incredibly difficult time screwing the screw into the very simple base. My hands were starting to hurt and I'm not a delicate wimp. The pain got to the point of hurting so much I just quit. It seemed sturdy enough screwed half way in, but that's -1 star because the hole didn't seem to match the size of the screw and it caused a problem.

Then came the spinning part. After the Ranger knob was attached, there was no way this sucker was going to spin. I had to unscrew the knob almost all the way to get the attachment to try to spin. That's another -1 star. I decided to tighten the knob and use the knob to spin the entire unit which will tear up what it's sitting on. Not cool.

Now to inserting my daubers. My metal arms seem very flimsy and in fact two of the eight pairs of arms are so far apart the handle of the dauber was falling through the arms. I tried and tried to squeeze them together to tighten them and to bring them closer together, but it wasn't working. I took a pair of pliers to one of the pairs of arms and was successful with closing the gap, however, it scraped up the surface and doing this more than once will certainly weaken the flimsy metal arms. That's another -1 star.

**I would very much appreciate it if someone could share their advice with me**

After all that manhandling, the entire unit looks nice and heavy-duty (eh not so much the arms) and is a fancy addition to my craft table. There isn't anything else like this that I've found, so I'm leaving this with a grade of 3 stars. Once screwed in, the base isn't going to be a problem anymore. The arms may or may not be a problem in the future. The extension is coming soon and I'm hoping the spinning will be easier.

Updated review after a week: doesn't spin no matter what I do. I put the extension on and the extension spins like a dream. I tried swapping the top and bottom shelves and the original shelf that came with the spinner does not fit on the extension pole. So since the bottom shelf doesn't spin AT ALL, how can I give this a positive review?Maybe the one I received is defective (?)Maybe the one I received is defective (?)Maybe the one I received is defective (?)",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717Gxj49HzL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

1251,"I was pretty skeptical about this stuff, knowing how difficult synthetics are to color. However, I needed some black polyester fiberfill, which is difficult to find and costs almost $20/lb.

I dyed the material for an hour. It clumped severely; this was a function of the fiberfill but I feel it worth mentioning in case anyone else has similar plans. The resulting color was surprisingly deep and it is invisible in the black amigurumi I am stuffing. Yes, it smokes quite a bit and smells bad, but that's what you get with a synthetic dye. It's an inherently noxious process.

I have to take off stars not because of the work it takes or the smell, but because of how impossibly difficult it is to wash out all of the excess dye. Even after multiple washings, I'm getting major transfer when I handle the dyed fiberfill. This is a major issue because the dye not only transfers to skin, but to other fabrics, and working with it means a risk of screwing something else up. Wearing clothing dyed with this is just asking for a disaster, both for the wearer and their surroundings.

So, five stars for the results I got on polyester, but minus two for the lack of dye fixing and the utter mess that occurs even after the dyed material has been washed. On the other hand, there are only a couple synthetic dyes available for home use, so I'm glad it worked as well as it did. Even with the transfer problems I will be buying other colors for making red and blue stuffing.

One last note, do yourself a favor and buy a cheap stainless steel stock pot that you don't mind using exclusively for dying. It will never be food-safe again, and it will be permanently stained as well. Also consider using an individual burner outside; I do not recommend using this indoors unless your stove has a hood and fan.Better than expected, but has one major problemBetter than expected, but has one major problemBetter than expected, but has one major problem",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pF0XyYybL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

I needed to add lock and flat washers and and they still don't hold the work surface up at any angle. I also had to cut a piece of lath to keep the work surface up from behind, like a lean-to.

The wood supports on the back of the work surface are glued way off center (see photo).

1271,"Really upset with this order. I made my quilt blocks using Kona 10"" squares (layer cake) and ordered yardage for the sashing; when I sewed my blocks together, I kept thinking there was an issue with the whites, but continued on. After I had the entire quilt top put together, it was obvious that the whites were different colors. The layer cake white is a pure, ""blinding"" white (really gorgeous), while the yardage is a dingy white. It's not that it looks like a different shade of white, it just looks dirty! My husband noticed it, too, which is saying a lot. I'm SUPER DISAPPOINTED!! I can either rip out all the sashing, purchase new yardage and then resew, or leave it, hoping my eyes will ""adjust"" to the difference. I bought three yards of the white, and it's useless to me now. I love Fabric.com, but am very upset about this order. After reading through the reviews I know I'm not alone, so buyer beware in this case.
I'll try to take some pictures, but wanted to put this review up as quickly as possible for others looking for this product.
EDITED: I added a picture of the quilt top with a close-up. I'm afraid the photos don't capture the great difference between the whites.

On the other hand the polished version suffers from 'flat spots' in over-polishing, and solid black/white beads but it seemed to be far less of the strand where it was an issue.While I like the matte look for a few of the beadsWhile I like the matte look for a few of the beadsWhile I like the matte look for a few of the beads",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LDKNSnnaL._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness

1276,"The colors are great but they are not good value. There's only about 1600 sequins total in their package. I determined that after separating the sequins into the Darice 1992-89 Clear Bead Organizer with 12 boxes (containers). I had purchased 600 packs of sequins from another vendor and when comparing the total of one 600 pack container to a container of one color from the Craft Medley pack I determined that it was approximately one third of the amount or 200 sequins. So 8 colors yields about 1600 sequins. Pretty colors but just very poor value.

The other issue as others have mentioned is the packaging. It literally took me hours to separate the sequins into separate containers (I bought all the color combos). The containers are shallow and you have to lift the lid very carefully or they all jump and spill into neighboring containers. If you are moving the sequins I'd recommend using a small teaspoon to scoop them up and transfer them. I'd prefer if these sequins were packaged in little baggies so they could just be poured into a container.

I added a picture so you can compare. On the left are approximately 200 x 7mm pink sequins from one section of the Craft Medley sequins and on the right are 800 x 5mm multi-color sequins from another vendor.Pretty colors, awful packaging, poor valuePretty colors, awful packaging, poor valuePretty colors, awful packaging, poor value",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816vdFzjHCL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

I had been looking at some of the more professional type pastels, but couldn't justify the money. These got great reviews for a cheaper brand, so I figured they would do what I needed them to do. I was previously using a cheap brand from Kroger that seemed to be more waxy like a crayon and didn't blend well, so hence the need to upgrade.

Based on the reviews, I was disappointed when I tried these. While the color selection is very good, and they are more firm than I would have expected (so they will last a little longer), they really did not blend any better than the cheap ones I was already using. Here you will see my comparison and the different methods that I used to blend them.

This Fiskars punch also works quite stiffly.  I have to stand up and push down hard to get it to punch cardstock.

1312,"I bought Snazaroo Face Paint (2 in light grey, 1 in white and 1 in black) and no matter what I did, the makeup would cake and crumble before I could get even coverage. I used very little water as recommended (I also tried more and less in other attempts hoping to fix the issue) and nothing helped. I tried applying with high quality smooth makeup sponges, my fingers and a foundation brush as well, hoping one of those might help but nothing did. I was left with makeup that kept wanting to get crumbly and flake off, and even after setting it, trying to apply shading lightly with a powder was a nightmare. I see so many good reviews for this, which is why I tried it over all others, but honestly, it really let me down and I am frustrated that I chose to use Snazaroo. All I wanted was a body paint with good coverage, non shiny finish, and no caking/crumbling/flaking/cracking. I give it two stars, as by the 5th try I had an ok looking application, but not even an hour later it was getting crumbly still. It did come off pretty easy and didn't irritate my skin, so another plus there. I didn't apply it with a heavy hand, and used the recommended smooth upward strokes. Overall though I am disappointed. From faraway it still looked fine, but any close ups and all you could see was a crumbly textured mess on my face.Awful, Maybe I got a bad batch?Awful, Maybe I got a bad batch?Awful, Maybe I got a bad batch?",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51x0WZpD6iL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

1317,"I bought this because I wanted to make my white shorts baby pink, and fill in more color to my washed out baby pink crop top jumper, and dye my grey Hollywood jumper because there were some stains on it. So in the photo the bottle dye looks baby pink clearly. When I received the bottle of dye, clearly the photo displaying it was not honest. It's clearly a deeper pink color.

And I'm somewhat happy and disappointed with the product. It made my shorts baby pink as I wanted them to. But the color did not catch the color as much, which is weird because the shorts were completely white and I expected it to catch on the color fast and be a bit darker.
And the baby pink jumper I had it turned cherry pink. I guess the material caught the color wayyyyyyy more. It is darker than I wanted it to and it looks blotchy cause the dye didn't get everywhere even thought I mixed the dye well. Bubbles must of got caught inside. But it's alright the change is cool.

But my Hollywood grey sweater came out an ugly color. I guess the Grey and whatever pink color that came out just turned an ugly pink. That's my biggest disappointment. I will be dying it black in the near future. I really don't like the color.

Some of the toggles fell apart prior to arrival, were on the verge of falling apart, or were missing components. After further examination, I believe this is due to undersized or possibly weak retainer tabs on the center plungers. In once case the tab broke off altogether. This appears to be affecting 8 of the toggles.

In another case the main body of the toggle was not fully molded (not enough plastic).

See attached photos.

To be perfectly honest, for markers, this paper just fails. Hard. Because of the glossy coating (on both sides. I tested.), the ink likes to pool, and it makes some bad effects.
As far as inking pens go, however, the paper handles itself quite well! The ink is nice and doesn't seem to pool as much.
And if you use colored pencil, the result is light, and chunky.

1327,"The colors are great but they are not good value. There's only about 1600 sequins total in their package. I determined that after separating the sequins into the Darice 1992-89 Clear Bead Organizer with 12 boxes (containers). I had purchased 600 packs of sequins from another vendor and when comparing the total of one 600 pack container to a container of one color from the Craft Medley pack I determined that it was approximately one third of the amount or 200 sequins. So 8 colors yields about 1600 sequins. Pretty colors but just very poor value.

The other issue as others have mentioned is the packaging. It literally took me hours to separate the sequins into separate containers (I bought all the color combos). The containers are shallow and you have to lift the lid very carefully or they all jump and spill into neighboring containers. If you are moving the sequins I'd recommend using a small teaspoon to scoop them up and transfer them. I'd prefer if these sequins were packaged in little baggies so they could just be poured into a container.

I added a picture so you can compare. On the left are approximately 200 x 7mm pink sequins from one section of the Craft Medley sequins and on the right are 800 x 5mm multi-color sequins from another vendor.Petty colors, awful packaging, poor valuePetty colors, awful packaging, poor valuePetty colors, awful packaging, poor value",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816vdFzjHCL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

WINK (the seller here at Amazon) authorized a free replacement for me, which was good of them. I am currently unable to get out owing to health issues + family members are preoccupied and cannot help with return shipping of the seriously FLAWED gel plate. So this was really good of WINK to do.
BUT. There are still problems, one to do with Amazon's shipping dept. and the other to do with product quality standards.
My gel plate's clamshell wasn't protected by any packing materials whatsoever, and this led to it becoming damaged en route. This wouldn't be a big deal if that same clamshell pkg were not the place to store this kind of gel plate between uses.
Within and on the surface of the second shipped plate are the same form of bubbles, only smaller. The surface looks a little like acne scars. The first plate was far worse, but all gel plates are supposed to be bubble free and totally free of blemishes on all surfaces. Their total smoothness is what makes prints taken from their surfaces actually turn out as they are supposed to.

1353,"These are really, really disappointing. First, I've been airbrushing miniatures and scale models for years, so I know how to properly prep a model and what to expect out of a primer. I can honestly say that Stynlrez is far behind Vallejo Polyurethane, P3 rattle can, and even the crummy Reaper brush-on primer.

I recently primed a metal miniature (yes -- I scrubbed it thoroughly to get rid of the release agent, and I let the primer cure for 2 or 3 days before painting) and was EXTREMELY disappointed to see how poorly these performed. After painting part of the model, I masked off a few areas with small amounts of blue poster tack. I airbrushed around it and went to remove the masking. Unfortunately, the paint and primer came right up when I removed the poster tack. I have used this same process for years, and I have NEVER seen primer come off like this. Check out the pictures to see the huge chunks of exposed metal -- the primer came off without any resistance. Terribly disappointing.

Note: I used the grey primer for this particular model. I gave this two stars out of hope that the black and/or white are better. I'm not going to risk it, though.

1371,"I purchased this to make confetti for party gift bags and sadly it was a huge disappointment.

First, its very difficult to even get out of the package.  It has four staples placed around each side but they're so close to the punch that you have to pry them out with a knife because a staple remover doesnt fit.

The punch itself is a good size and solid but it is very difficult to actually punch things.  It takes a lot of effort to get it to punch which is frustrating and annoying.  The cutter is also not very sharp since it leaves edges rather ragged and curled.  Its also difficult to see where you're punching because of the way it is designed.  Also, when lined up with the guide on it you punch rather far in from the edge of the paper which is great if you want to make a border, but not great if you want to get as many punches from a piece of paper as possible.

The deal breaker for me was the tiny door on the punch compartment.  The compartment only holds about five punches before it has to be emptied which is a pain in and of itself, but then you need to open and replace the door which is virtually impossible.  The little door does not line up correctly and you need to fiddle with it to get it back on which takes at least a couple minutes - every single time you open it.

Overall, the punch does not cut well and the punch compartment does not open or close so this is really a waste of money if you plan to use it often.

I have even used a jumbo skein on it and it works fine.  As for the squeaking issue some reviewers have; I have not had that issue but then again I am not unwinding yarn at lightening speed either.  It is compact enough to take along and toss into my yarn bag.

It's not a matter of paper weight. Even with no paper in it, the interior shape cannot possibly fit through the exterior shape, so there is no way to cut the paper.

I primed both wicks with a little olive oil, wiped off, and dipped in my soy wax before pouring. The single wick barely stays lit but the double wick is doing great (see photo, single wick on left). Neither crackle, but that's okay. I will definitely use these wood wicks for container candles and double-up AND prime them. If you double-up, they fit well in the clips and you'll have just enough. It's worth a try for the price, compared to other wood wicks. Small amount of prepping isn't inconvenient if you're pouring candles anyway. I will buy these again. Hint-- cut to size individually with regular scissors. Once doubled-up, hard to cut (I trimmed wicks after pouring and used a wire cutter). I salvaged the other candle by carving out a little wax and inserting second wick next to first.Worth the price with small modification and a little prepWorth the price with small modification and a little prepWorth the price with small modification and a little prep",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Tnd49E1JL._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness
1396,"Older eyes make needle threading a REAL problem. This nifty little gadget for hand sewing needles turns what used to be at least 5 minutes of turning the air blue as I tried and tried to poke the thread through that tiny hole into a quick and easy 5 second or so process. I would say that any needle crafter of any age should get one just to spare them that aggravation, whether they can see it well or not. There is a slight learning curve but once you practice a couple of times it becomes almost effortless and MUCH less frustrating. It is not for use with round eye hand needles - they have to have an oval eye.
The two holes at either end are for use with Cotton and Silk threads, you simply drop the needle in head first, push ***gently*** on the center button to engage the needle threader in the eye of the needle to make sure it's lined up correctly, let go, drop the thread into the slot next to the needle, and push the button again. There is a tiny notched ""finger"" that catches the thread and pushes it through the eye before springing back. You do have to grab the thread loop on the side and hold it as you remove the needle so the thread doesn't pull itself out but it all takes about 5 seconds.
I wouldn't suggest that this be used by children (or careless adults) simply because the needle goes into the machine with the point UP so you do need to be careful with it and not poke yourself. Otherwise, I recommend it highly.Works, and works well.Works, and works well.Works, and works well.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/411qZtDcRWL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41pQF1rM0aL._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness

1398,"I bought Snazaroo Face Paint (2 in this grey, 1 in white and 1 in black) and no matter what I did, the makeup would cake and crumble before I could get even coverage.

I tried applying with high quality smooth makeup sponges, my fingers and a foundation brush as well, hoping one of those might help but nothing did. I was left with makeup that kept wanting to get crumbly and flake off, and even after setting it, trying to apply shading lightly with a powder was a nightmare. I see so many good reviews for this, which is why I tried it over all others, but honestly, it really let me down and I am frustrated that I chose to use Snazaroo. All I wanted was a body paint with good coverage, non shiny finish, and no caking/crumbling/flaking/cracking. I give it two stars, as by the 5th try I had an ok looking application, but not even an hour later it was getting crumbly still. It did come off pretty easy and didn't irritate my skin, so another plus there. I didn't apply it with a heavy hand, and used the recommended smooth upward strokes. Overall though I am disappointed.

1410,"The colors are great but they are not good value. There's only about 1600 sequins total in their package. I determined that after separating the sequins into the Darice 1992-89 Clear Bead Organizer with 12 boxes (containers). I had purchased 600 packs of sequins from another vendor and when comparing the total of one 600 pack container to a container of one color from the Craft Medley pack I determined that it was approximately one third of the amount or 200 sequins. So 8 colors yields about 1600 sequins. Pretty colors but just very poor value.

The other issue as others have mentioned is the packaging. It literally took me hours to separate the sequins into separate containers (I bought all the color combos). The containers are shallow and you have to lift the lid very carefully or they all jump and spill into neighboring containers. If you are moving the sequins I'd recommend using a small teaspoon to scoop them up and transfer them. I'd prefer if these sequins were packaged in little baggies so they could just be poured into a container.

I added a picture so you can compare. On the left are approximately 200 x 7mm pink sequins from one section of the Craft Medley sequins and on the right are 800 x 5mm multi-color sequins from another vendor.Pretty colors, awful packaging and poor valuePretty colors, awful packaging and poor valuePretty colors, awful packaging and poor value",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816vdFzjHCL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

So in the photo the bottle dye looks baby pink clearly. When I received the bottle of dye, clearly the photo displaying it was not honest. It's clearly a deeper pink color.

And I'm somewhat happy and disappointed with the product. It made my shorts baby pink as I wanted them to. But the color did not catch the color as much, which is weird because the shorts were completely white and I expected it to catch on the color fast and be a bit darker.
And the baby pink jumper I had it turned cherry pink. I guess the material caught the color wayyyyyyy more. It is darker than I wanted it to and it looks blotchy cause the dye didn't get everywhere even thought I mixed the dye well. Bubbles must of got caught inside. But it's alright the change is cool.

But my Hollywood grey sweater came out an ugly color. I guess the Grey and whatever pink color that came out just turned an ugly pink. That's my biggest disappointment. I will be dying it black in the near future. I really don't like the color.

1493,"Im an amateur artist and Ive been spoiled by Faber Castells wonderful line of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pitt-Brush-Pens/dp/B000PSZ304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pitt Brush Pens</a>, but Ive heard plenty of good things about the Sakura Pigma Brush Pens. I decided to give these a try, but they're not as good as everyone says they are, and all the colors, in comparison to the Pitt Brush Pens, are too saturated and look like runny, poor-quality watercolors. Some people may be looking for an eye-blinding, generic crimson red or a depthless Kelly Green or a  plain-looking blue (all of which are in this pack), but Ive found that such bright colors are hard to use in my artwork.
The caps and colored plastic bottoms are also inaccurate to the colors. The ink colors are already too saturated for my tastes, yet the plastic bottoms are even more saturated than the ink.  The metallic caps look like different colors in certain lights, which was not a smart design choice for Sakura, and even in regular daylight, the purple cap looks pink.

At least they handle like a decently springy brush pen, and haven't shown any sign of running out yet. Ive been told that these brush pens can fray or dry out quickly, but Ive had them for four months and they have still held up from occasional use.

Maybe I don't buy for the hype, and maybe its a matter of personal taste, but Im not a fan of these brush pens. For the price, they're not bad brush pens for a little more than a dollar each, and they would be a good place to start to get familiar with using brush pens. But if you have the money and want a better selection of colors, go for the Pitt Brush Pens. They are a much better investment than these.Overhyped, looks like runny watercolors.

1508,"This line of yarn offers a variety of color ways , from neutral grays and creams, to soft pastels and vibrant jewel tones. As other reviewers have reported, the weight/ thickness varies within the skein. There are some sections that are very thin, almost thread-like. It is categorized as a medium weight (4). Some segments might be, but overall it varies. I believe this makes it difficult to knit with, especially to cast on.  I have made a few crocheted pieces. I used a 5.0 mm hook. You need to be careful when you need to rip out stitches to correct errors. The yarn snags and tears easily. Also, the ends tend to fray, so I do not recommend using this for fringe or tassels.

The smell of this stuff smells like anything but beeswax. It smells like chemicals, toxins, pesticide, you name it. I thought it may just be the plastic it was in so I put it into a clean Ziploc bag. The smell is still there after removing it from the packaging. I cannot use this for what it was intended for. I was going to make homemade baby diaper rash cream since I cloth diaper but this stuff cannot be used. I may try something like rinsing with cold water in hopes that god awful smell goes away, and hoping it's just a residual smell from the packaging. I won't use this stuff for anything in my homemade products, especially ones for my baby. I won't even use this POOP for a candle. I will say this, the color is good the pellets are a good size but that's about it. I'll post several photos some with flash and some without. I will not be buying from this company again and I'll take my money elsewhere. Honestly I don't care at this point if I spend a lot of money for something I know won't be this bad. I will not recommend this to anyone ever. I know other's who've bought from this company have had good experience in getting good quality beeswax and I've read that some have had  hit's and misses. As I said I will not take that chance to have more useless product. SELLERS please for the sake of other's, whatever you did to the beeswax just stop. this stuff can be and is used for INFANT products. If someone was noseblind, used this stuff with who know's what is in it, and ended up resulting in harm of an infant. Shame on you. I will do this though, I will still make something using this stuff for the sake of testing if the smell remains and causes my skin a reaction, then give you an update.

I have da vinci (series 10, 11, 35) and they are BY FAR SUPERIOR and most importantly CONSISTENT. I'm returning my series 7 for another series 11 da vinci. I've noticed my escoda reserva splits, but only with lower degrees of water in the brush. When saturated it's perfect, but as the water is removed it splits. But my series 7 split literally sopping with water. When it was damp it looked like Albert Einstein. See photos of brush with varying levels of water and splitting.

With all this said, I do have a couple smaller  series 7 brushes that are fine - 0, 1, 2, 4 and 1/4 flat. But once you go above a 4 it's over. The 8 I bought from Amazon and the 10 I bought from Jerry's were both garbage and returned.

Do yourself a favor, get a da vinci. Their quality far exceeds series 7 but most importantly when you spend the money you will consistently get a great brush.

I didn't go through all the beads, but of the ones that I did I found more than 10 that had major defects -- stones in backwards (yep, foil OUT!), missing stones, blobs of metal in place of stones, stones with zero polish so they had no shine, etc. Over 10% defects is pretty bad in my opinion. These should be taken off Amazon's listing, actually because they are misrepresenting items as genuine Swarovski when they reallly are not. I am not sure if I'll try to use these at all, as I would need to remove and reset numerous rhinestones. I plan to contact Amazon to see if I can get a refund.

1559,"I was pretty skeptical about this stuff, knowing how difficult synthetics are to color. However, I needed some black polyester fiberfill, which is difficult to find and costs almost $20/lb.

I dyed the material for an hour. It clumped severely; this was a function of the fiberfill but I feel it worth mentioning in case anyone else has similar plans. The resulting color was surprisingly deep and it is invisible in the black amigurumi I am stuffing. Yes, it smokes quite a bit and smells bad, but that's what you get with a synthetic dye. It's an inherently noxious process.

I have to take off stars not because of the work it takes or the smell, but because of how impossibly difficult it is to wash out all of the excess dye. Even after multiple washings, I'm getting major transfer when I handle the dyed fiberfill. This is a major issue because the dye not only transfers to skin, but to other fabrics, and working with it means a risk of screwing something else up. Wearing clothing dyed with this is just asking for a disaster, both for the wearer and their surroundings.

So, five stars for the results I got on polyester, but minus two for the lack of dye fixing and the utter mess that occurs even after the dyed material has been washed. On the other hand, there are only a couple synthetic dyes available for home use, so I'm glad it worked as well as it did. Even with the transfer problems I will be buying other colors for making red and blue stuffing.

One last note, do yourself a favor and buy a cheap stainless steel stock pot that you don't mind using exclusively for dying. It will never be food-safe again, and it will be permanently stained as well. Also consider using an individual burner outside; I do not recommend using this indoors unless your stove has a hood and fan.Better than expected, but has one major problemBetter than expected, but has one major problemBetter than expected, but has one major problem",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pF0XyYybL._SY88.jpg,negative,sadness

1573,"I am an avid scrapbooker and a mom of four kids.  Between my scrapbooking and the kids' school projects, we end up doing a lot of crafts.  One thing I am very guilty of is cutting on surfaces that should not be cut on such as the table, etc...  I have needed a mat like this for a while.  I have another one that is really small and just not useful.

This mat is 12x18 so I can fit my entire piece of 12x12 scrapbooking paper on it.  I mostly use 12x12 paper so I need a surface that will fit my paper.  With this mat I can use an Exacto Knife and cut my paper.  I also have a round rotary blade I can use.  If you use a mat like this with a blade, the cool thing is that you don't have to worry about it cutting through your mat or damaging the mat.  You just cut what you need then this self-healing mat, does what it says and basically leaves no cuts behind on the mat.  What I can see are tiny scratches and that is the same as the smaller mat I have.  This mat is exactly what I need and has a nice sturdy feel to it.  I am very pleased with this mat.  Because it is a self-healing mat, it should last for a very long time and really gives me just the surface I need when scrapbooking, cutting fabric or helping my kids with a school project. The mat has grid lines on it so that it is really easy to line up paper so that I cut exactly where I need to cut and can measure.

(See pic of the unicorn and castle) I read on some other nail artists' blogs that this was a commonly used brand for nail art, so I went for it. I like this set overall, but there was one bottle of dark green paint that was almost dried out (the seller needs better quality control checks). Luckily I was able to salvage it by using Winsor's Acrylic Flow Improver - which was an added expense and why I took off one star. Also, if you don't already have one, I'd recommend using a wet palette with this, which will help prevent your paint from drying out too quickly.Great set of acrylic colors, but one was almost dried out!Great set of acrylic colors, but one was almost dried out!Great set of acrylic colors, but one was almost dried out!",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717eK1WDhAL._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness

(1) PLASTIC ADHESIVE TAPE: This product is best described as tape, not lace. It may be described as paper thin, plastic adhesive. As such, it does not look at all like lace.

(2)  THIN, SEE-THROUGH: The product is very thin, which causes it to be partially see-through when applied to paper of contrasting color. It also looks rather cheap because it is so thin.

(3) IMPERFECT PATTERN: The ""lace"" that is depicted has holes that give it a lace-like pattern. However, the tape did not have all the holes pre-detached. When I peeled it from its backing the holes still did not detach. Therefore, the pattern in the tape looked fairly bad.

1618,"I just received this sewing machine yesterday. So far I'm not impressed. The main trouble is the speed. It only has one and it's very fast -- like being in high gear all the time. This is an issue because the motor doesn't even move -- just hums -- with slight pressure on the peddle. To get the needle moving, you have to give it a little 'nudge' to overcome inertia in the over-geared motor, which causes the needle to race. Once the motor is moving, only then can you bring it down to a slow controlled speed. By then the stitch is crooked. I've managed to make maybe one straight stitch on some practice fabric.

I'm also skeptical about heavy duty aspect. I was just running practice seems over some thin woven cotton cloth. Three layers caused some struggle. Again, you really had to goose the speed control to get the needle through the fabric, which caused it to race, which causes the feed dogs to not grip the fabric, which causes all the stitches to pile up. I don't see a foot pressure setting on the machine or in the manual either. Everything about this machine screams for a lower gear.

I'm contemplating sending this one back. I'm also now very skeptical of Amazon reviews. This is the second thing I've purchased with near 5-star that turned out to not be very good according to outside reviews.

Also, the controls are not very good. I kept wondering if there was even an overcast stitch. These goofy images of stitches don't make a lot of sense to me. I did find a key online, however, which is very helpful. Attached.

1642,"Masterclass's sketchbook is designed for all dry media including pen, pencil, charcoal, marker, pastels, crayons, and sketching sticks. When I buy sketchbooks I normally look for mixed media sketch books because I like to paint as well so I'm used to a thicker quality of paper.

I'm pretty heavy handed when I sketch pictures and when I draw in Masterclass's sketchbook the 2-3 pages behind my sketch have deep impressions. I like to keep my sketches in my sketchbook so I don't remove the paper before I draw. You can see an example in my photos.

Overall I like the quality of the paper and my completed sketch. I think Masterclass's sketchbook is appropriately priced for the quality and value of their product.

TL;DR

Pros:
Hardcover
Versatile dry medium paper
Twin Loop Spiral Binding
Permanent marker doesn't bleed through
Perforated paper edge

Cons:
Impressions left on pages behind each sketch
Dry medium paper, no painting

Ratings (Out of five stars):
Paper Thickness: *4*

In places the bias seams are crooked/don't line up and the fabric needs to be cut and seams re-done. in other places there are random cuts/tears in fabric. In other places it isn't even seamed together - it is taped. See attached photos for reference.

For the quality and quantity the price isn't bad, however I definitely would not recommend using this bias tape for projects that will get heavy use or projects that you have invested a lot of time and/or money in. Definitely not recommended for quilts.

1670,"These charcoal sticks are, overall, mostly useless.  I didn't bother to try out their feel on some paper, because I knew I wouldn't be keeping them.  Here are my complaints:

The sticks come in two bundles, each about half the length of the box they come in.  Each stick is about the length of my thumb.  The problem I have with this is that these sticks are too short to be economical!  There are time I will want a longer stick and time when I want a shorter stick of charcoal.  But this isn't too much of a problem, to be honest, because the length is about right for most uses.  I just prefer a longer charcoal stick to break off pieces from.  (I think that's just a preference of habit.)

But here's where the more pertinent issue comes in: the majority of the sticks in each bundle are about the thickness of a strand of hair.  Ok that's exaggerating it a bit, but my point remains.  Most of the sticks are too skinny to use.  It's as if they used the pine needles instead of the branches to make the charcoal.  I mean, you have to really try to get charcoal this skinny!  The problem with skinny sticks is that they are really difficult to grip and they fall apart at the drop of a hat.

Overall, I really wouldn't recommend this charcoal.  You're not getting what you pay for.  The pictures on the listing are misleading because they imply longer sticks and a greater population of thicker sticks.Not a good buy at allNot a good buy at allNot a good buy at all",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Iobo7Py+L._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71avaMuPIZL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X1jwPS4CL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61JMPKPAqdL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tYfx3hClL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ek5jvOENL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ziQ2OgUvL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718nHEC-WWL._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness

1676,"Just started my project with this yarn. I knit on a loom not with knitting needles. The yarn is a bit hard to work with, kind of separates and bunches together and the ends fray badly. Love the color, reminds my of Goldie Locks hair. I hope the project does not look all frayed when I am finished.
UPDATE: This is the worst yarn you can buy. I wish I could give it less than one star. It bunched, frayed, separated and caused me nothing but problems. The last few stitches, even knitting without any tension at all, the yarn broke which made my project a piece of trash. I will never buy this brand of yarn again. I knit hats for the homeless in my area and they deserve better than this.
UPDATE #2: I contacted Lion Brand yarn with the same review as above. Their customer service is AWESOME. Debbie contacted me and offered me a replacement. I knit hats for the homeless and she helped me pick something that would give me the most bang for my buck. I probably won't buy this TYPE of yarn again but I will definitely buy Lion Brand!BEAUTIFUL COLOR, A BIT HARD TO WORK WITHBEAUTIFUL COLOR, A BIT HARD TO WORK WITHBEAUTIFUL COLOR, A BIT HARD TO WORK WITH",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zBF3KdqvL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71f+pLz6paL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MucpcvQqL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e2yLftHuL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V8YRyfktL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wEuxzi+CL._SY88.jpg; https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S-lEvk4iL._SY88.jpg,negative,happiness
